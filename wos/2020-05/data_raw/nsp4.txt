Description of a second species of Gymnoxenisthmus from the Red Sea (Teleostei: Gobioidei: Xenisthmidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Indo-Pacific; ichthyology; systematics; taxonomy; morphology; Gymnoxenisthmus flavicinctus	FISH; GOBIIDAE; GENUS	Gymnoxenisthmus flavicinctus n. sp. is described from the 20.2 mm SL holotype collected from Sharm Obhur, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, central Red Sea. It differs from the holotype and only known specimen of its congener G. tigrellus in having entirely unbranched pectoral-fin rays (versus only upper two rays and lowermost ray unbranched), 17 (versus 15) pectoral-fin rays and 13 (versus 12) segmented anal-fin rays. It also differs in live and preserved coloration. The new species brings the total number of xenisthmids known from the Red Sea to five.

Review of the fish parasitic genus Elthusa Schioedte & Meinert, 1884 (Crustacea, Isopoda, Cymothoidae) from South Africa, including the description of three new species	ZOOKEYS			English	Review						Alexander Bay; Atlantic Ocean; Clinus superciliosus; Elthusa raynaudii; fish parasites; Indian Ocean; taxonomy	REDESCRIPTION; CALIFORNIA; OCEAN; GILL	The branchial-attaching cymothoid genus, Elthusa Schioedte & Meinert, 1884 is a genus with a worldwide distribution of 36 species, including the three species described here. Elthusa raynaudii (Milne Edwards, 1840) is the only species that has been described from southern Africa. All South African material held at the National Museum of Natural History, Paris, France (MNHN) and the Iziko South African Museum, Cape Town (SAMC) identified as, or appearing to belong to, Elthusa was examined. Four species were identified, Elthusa raynaudii and three species that proved to be undescribed. Elthusa xena sp. n. can be distinguished by an evenly rounded pereonite 1 anterior margin, a roughly rectangular pleotelson, and narrowly rounded uropod apices that extend to more than half the length of the pleotelson. Elthusa acutinasa sp. n. is identified by the produced and narrowly rounded cephalon anterior margin, acute uropods that are shorter than half the length of the pleotelson, and pereonite 1 anterior margin with medial projection. Elthusa rotunda sp. n. is characterised by the round body shape, broadly rounded uropod apices, and protrusions on the proximal and lateral margins of the merus and carpus of pereopod 7. A key to the South African Elthusa species is provided, together with a table summarising the hosts and localities of the 33 previously known species of Elthusa.

In this region, the Serra da Mantiqueira and the Complexo do Espinhaco are the highest points of the Brazilian Shield and delimits the headwaters of four drainages: Sao Francisco, Parana, Doce and Paraiba do Sul basins. Harttia intermontana, n. sp., is described from the headwaters of the Rio Doce basin and is the first record of the genus in this basin. The new species can be distinguished from its congeners by the pattern of abdominal covering, presence of preanal plates, presence and pattern of ornamentation of canal plate, and some characteristics related to sexual dimorphism. Pareiorhaphis togoroi, n. sp., is described from the headwaters of the Rio das Mortes basin, tributary to the Rio Grande, in the upper Rio Parana drainage, and represents the first record of the genus to this drainage, thus expanding its geographic distribution. It can be distinguished from most congeners by the absence of preadipose azygous plates, and characteristics related to secondary sexual characters of mature males: presence of odontodes on the lateral margin of head plus the absence of long hypertrophied odontodes on pectoral-fin spine. Neoplecostomus pirangaensis, n. sp., is described from the headwaters of the Rio Piranga, Rio Doce basin. The new species differs from all congeners by the much-reduced dermal platelets on the abdomen, devoid of developed odontodes between the insertions of the pectoral and pelvic fins. Neoplecostomus pirangaensis can also be distinguished from all congeners, except N. botucatu and N. paranensis, due to the complete absence of vestiges of the adipose fin (vs. vestiges, or adipose fin moderate to well developed and always present). The new species differs from N. botucatu by the absence of conspicuous dark spots all over the body and the presence of common dorsal bands in juveniles, and almost totally black in adults. It differs from N. paranensis by the bigger and less numerous teeth. Additionally, the new species differs from Neoplecostomus doceensis by the absence of enlarged fleshy folds between dentaries, and absence of a lateronasal plate.

Following Pilsbly's formal criteria of a single palatal fold and corresponding external furrow, the new species may he assigned to Parennea. Emma nigeriensis sp. n. exhibits substantial similarity with E. serrata, a species from Cameroon, in the cylindrical shell shape, crenulate suture, and internal shell morphology, indicating that the two species are closely related. CT scanning confirmed the presence of only a single palatal fold in E. nigeriensis sp. n. and two in E. set-rata. In spite of this, the Nigerian species is provisionally assigned to Ennea rather than Parennea, suggesting that the characters used to define Ennea and Parennea are insufficient to delimit natural groups of species. The holotype of E. serrata is examined for the first time since its description in 1896 and a redescription of the species is provided based on the two shells hitherto known. Study of the original specimens recorded as Ptychotrema (Parennea) sulciferum by Degner from Liberia reveals these to belong to Ennea cf. thompsonae. The Nigerian shell recorded by van Bruggen as Ptychotrema (Parennea) aequatoriale proved to be a specimen of Ennea d per rata. As a result, no species attributable to Parennea now appear to be known in West Africa; in contrast, numerous species are known from central and eastern Africa.	[de Winter, A.

Our recent study on the Georissa of Malaysian Borneo has revealed high intra- and inter-specific variation in the "scaly" group (a group of species with striking scale-like surface sculpture). The present study on the "non-scaly" Georissa is the continuation of the species revision for the genus. The "non-scaly" species are also diverse in shell sculptures. This informal group comprises Georissa with subtle spiral and/or radial sculpture. The combination of detailed conchological usessment and molecular analyses provides clear distinctions for each of the species. Conchological, molecular, and biogeographic details are presented for 16 species of "non-scaly" Georissa. Three of these are new to science, namely Georissa corrugata sp. n., Georissa insulae sp. n., and Georissa trusmadi sp. n.

J	Li, HH; Bidzilya, O				Li, Houhun; Bidzilya, Oleksiy			New species and new records of the genus Scrobipalpa Janse (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) from China	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Gnorimoschemini; new combination; new synonymy; Palaearctic Region; taxonomy		An annotated list of 71 specks of the genus Scrobipalpa in China is given. Nine species of the genus Scrobipalpa Janse, 1951 are described as new: S. triangulella sp. n. (Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi), S. punctulata sp. n. (Henan, Shanxi), S. septentrionalis sp. n. (Heilongjiang, Ningxia), S. zhongweina sp. n. (Ningxia), S. tripunctella sp. n. (Hebei, Ningxia, Shanxi), S. ningxica sp. n. (Ningxia), S. psammophila sp. n. (Ningxia), S. zhengi sp. n. (Inner Mongolia, Ningxia), and S. liui sp. n. (Shanxi). Scrobipalpa gorodkovi Bidzilya, 2012 is synonymised with S. subnitens Povolny, 1967. The female of S. flavinerva Bidzilya & Li, 2010 is described for the first time. Two new combinations are proposed: Scrobipalpa perfecta (Povolny, 1996), comb. a, Scrobipalpa suaveolens (Povolny, 1996), comb. n. Twelve species of Scrobipalpa are recorded from China for the first time. Scrobipalpa cryptica Povolny, 1996, S. proclivella (Fuchs, 1886) and S. smithi Povoln)% & Bradley, 1964 are removed from the list of Scrobipalpa of China due to misidentification.

The new species likely belongs to a complex consisting of C. mirationis, C. okamurai and C. struhsakeri, with which it shares the following character combination: dorsal rays XIV,13-14; anal rays II,12; pectoral rays 19-20; tubed lateral-line scales 15-17; two spinous procurrent rays dorsally and ventrally in the caudal fm; and a generally silvery white adult coloration. The new species differs from the other members of its complex in coloration details (particularly in juvenile coloration), and in having fewer gill rakers (5-6 + 17-20 = 22-26), and a larger eye (13.7-19.4 % SL). The new species has previously been confused with Chromis mirationis, and the contention is herewith briefly discussed.

Lycodon namdongensis sp. nov. is differentiated from its congeners by a combination of the following characters: dorsal scales in 17-17-15 rows, all smooth; supralabials 8; infralabials 10; one large loreal on each side, separated from the eye; cloacal single; ventral scales 218 (plus two preventral scales); subcaudals 85, paired; a total length of 723 mm; tail / total length ratio 0.205; dorsal head pattern whitish grey; dorsal surface of body with 23 narrow greyish cream bands; dorsal surface of tail with 14 cream bands; ventral surface of body mostly cream with a few small dark spots posteriorly; ventral surface of tail dark grey. Based on molecular comparisons, Lycodon namdongensis sp. nov. is recovered as a sister species to L. futsingensis with strong support values from all three analyses. The new species is at least 6.5% genetically divergent from other species within this Glade as shown by a fragment of more than 1000 pbs of the mitochondrial cytochrome b. This discovery increases the number of Lycodon species known from Vietnam to 15.

The new genus is distinctive because it lacks the typical fusion of M and R (radiomedial fusion, R-s+M) which is found in all but a few species-poor, and apparently unrelated, genera of keroplatids. Also unusual is the absence of vein R2+3 and the strong sexual dimorphism in the thorax; males are dark brown and females bright orange.

Multilocus genetic and morphological phylogenetic analysis reveals a radiation of shiny South Asian jumping spiders (Araneae, Salticidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Chrysillini; cryptic species; ecomorphs; India; monophyly; new genera; parsimony; synapomorphies	RIBOSOMAL DNA-SEQUENCES; SRI-LANKA; PRINCIPAL EYES; EVOLUTION; CONSERVATION; TREE; DIVERSIFICATION; PHINTELLA; SOFTWARE; REVISION	This study presents a systematic revision of South Asian members of the Tribe Chrysillini Simon, 1901. Genetic and morphological variations were analysed of a "similar-looking" group of species that were initially identified as members of the jumping spider genera Chrysilla Thorell, 1887 and Phintella Strand, in Bosenberg and Strand 1906 to determine their phylogenetic relationships. Results suggest that the assessed morphospecies complex constitute of three evolutionary lineages, two previously unrecognised, which are described and diagnosed as two new genera: Phintelloides gen. n. and Proszynskia gen. n. The third lineage, Phintella, is sister to these proposed genera. The following new species are described: Phintelloides alborea sp. n., P. brunne sp. n., P. flavoviri sp. n., P. flavumi sp. n., P. orbisa sp. n., Phintella argentea sp. n., and P. jaleeli sp. n. Sri Lanka is rich in biodiversity but currently has one of the highest rates of deforestation. Lack of clarity on diversity and distribution of the islands' biodiversity can lead to under-estimations during threat assessments and thus downgrading of conservation needs of individual species.

EUTARDIGRADA; INTEGRATIVE REDESCRIPTION; NATIONAL-PARK; PHYLUM TARDIGRADA; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FREEZE TOLERANCE; EMBRYONIC STAGES; STORAGE-CELLS; NOMINAL TAXON; DOYERE	Intra- and interspecific variability, being at the very core of alpha taxonomy, has been a long-standing topic of debate among tardigrade taxonomists. Early studies tended to assume that tardigrades exhibit wide intraspecific variation. However, with more careful morphological studies, especially those incorporating molecular tools that allow for an independent verification of species identifications based on phenotypic traits, we now recognise that ranges of tardigrade intraspecific variability are narrower, and that differences between species may be more subtle than previously assumed. The taxonomic history of the genus Milnesium, and more specifically that of the nominal species, M. tardigradum described by Doyere in 1840, is a good illustration of the evolution of views on intraspecific variability in tardigrades. The assumption of wide intraspecific variability in claw morphology led Marcus (1928) to synonymise two species with different claw configurations, M. alpigenum and M. quadrifidum, with M. tardigradum. Currently claw configuration is recognised as one of the key diagnostic traits in the genus Milnesium, and the two species suppressed by Marcus have recently been suggested to be valid. In this study, we clarify the taxonomic status of M. alpigenum, a species that for nearly a century was considered invalid. We redescribe M. alpigenum, using a population collected from the locus typicus, by the means of integrative taxonomy, i.e. including light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, ontogenetic observations, and genetic barcoding. Moreover, the redescription of M. alpigenum allowed us to verify the uncertain taxonomic status of two popular laboratory models that were originally considered to be M. tardigradum; though one was recently reidentified as M. cf. alpigenum. Our analysis showed that both laboratory strains, despite being morphologically and morphometrically nearly identical to M. alpigenum, in fact represent a new species, M. inceptum sp. nov. The two species, being disnguishable only by statistical morphometry and/or DNA sequences, are the first example of pseudocryptic species in tardigrades.

SP.; EPIBIONT; BALANOMORPHA; EVOLUTION	Coronuloid barnacles are epibionts of several marine vertebrates (including cetaceans and sea turtles) as well as invertebrates, and are assigned to two families of turtle barnacles (Chelonibiidae Pilsbry, 1916 and Platylepadidae Newman & Ross, 1976) and one family of whale barnacles (Coronulidae Leach, 1817). Chelonibiids and coronulids have a scanty, albeit significant fossil record extending back to the Eocene and Pliocene, respectively; in turn, the fossil record of platylepadids is limited to a single record from the Upper Pleistocene. Here we report on an isolated carinolateral compartment of Platylepas Gray, 1825, the type genus of the family, from Lower Pleistocene (Gelasian) epibathyal deposits exposed at Milazzo (Sicily, Italy). This specimen is here designated holotype of a new species, dagger Platylepas mediterranea sp. nov. We argue that, like most extant members of Platylepas, dagger P. mediterranea sp. nov. lived partially embedded in the skin of a sea turtle. This record of an extinct platylepadid - the first from the Mediterranean region and the second worldwide - pushes back the fossil record of Platylepadidae to the lowermost Quaternary, thus possibly supporting an even earlier (e.g., Neogene) timing for the origin of this family and adding a new chapter to the evolutionary history of one of the most diverse and successful lineages of epizoic crustaceans.

Two new species and new findings in the genus Pallenopsis (Pycnogonida: Pallenopsidae) with an updated identification key to Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Antarctica; Bathypallenopsis; Pycnogonids; sea spider; Sub-Antarctica; taxonomy	SEA SPIDERS ARTHROPODA; HOEK; PHYLOGENY	The present contribution describes and discusses the observed morphological variability of pycnogonids in the genus Pallenopsis collected during the Italica XIX cruise to Victoria Land, Ross Sea, Antarctica (3 Feb-4 Mar, 2004). Four species are recognized in this collection and two of them are proposed as new species Pallenopsis gracilis n. sp. and Pallenopsis rotunda n. sp. The new species are described, illustrated, and compared morphologically with their closest congeners. The morphological diagnostic characters of the subgenus Bathypallenopsis are discussed and considered insufficient to justify a separation into subgenera. The observed morphological variability is instead proposed to be accommodated in one inclusive genus Pallenopsis. Finally, we propose an updated dichotomous key to all currently recognized Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic Pallenopsis species (adult form), and discuss some of the more disputable taxa, highlighting the lack of knowledge of the morphological and molecular characters of this genus.

New insights into the identities of the elasmobranch fauna of Sri Lanka	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Elasmobranchii; Batoidea; Selachii; sharks; rays; biodiversity; new species; new records; Indian Ocean	SPOTTED MASKRAY MYLIOBATOIDEI; SP-NOV; DASYATIDAE; CHONDRICHTHYES; MYLIOBATIFORMES; CENTROPHORUS; DIVERSITY; SHARKS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Identities of elasmobranchs from Sri Lanka encountered during collections conducted in an intensive nine-day survey of fish markets and landing sites at 11 localities in the North Western, Northern, and Eastern Provinces in March of 2018 were assessed. In total, 111 specimens representing 34 elasmobranch species were examined. Sequence data for the NADH2 gene were generated for all specimens. Independent Neighbor-Joining analyses, which included data for related taxa, were conducted for 25 subgroups of elasmobranchs to help confirm specific identifications. Five of the 34 species encountered are likely new to science. These consist of one species each of the batoid genera Brevitrygon, Narcine, and Torpedo, and the selachian genera Centrophorus, and Chiloscyllium. The specific identities of 12 species previously known to occur in Sri Lanka are updated to conform to current taxonomy; four of these (Gymnura cf. poecilura 2, Carcharhinus cf. limbatus, Echinorhinus sp. 1, and lago cf. omanensis 1) represent what appear to be undescribed species reported previously from other localities. Three species (Maculabatis arabica, Acroteriobatus variegatus, and Centroscymnus owstonii) are reported from Sri Lanka for the first time; the latter species also represents the first documented record of this genus and family for the island nation. One of the two specimens on which the recent description of the new species of Planonasus indicus was based was also collected as part of this survey. Although some of the species confirmed to occur in Sri Lanka have also been found in India, others were previously known only from the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, or localities in Southeast Asia. The high amount of novelty discovered as a result of a survey of such short duration emphasizes the importance of more intensive survey efforts in this region now that the civil unrest that precluded such work for nearly three decades has come to an end.

FRESH-WATER CRAB; GENUS SUNDATHELPHUSA; CAVERNICOLOUS CRAB; FAUNA CRUSTACEA; SAMAR	The taxonomy of the Sundathelphusa philippina (von Martens, 1868) species group (Brachyura; Gecarcinucidae) from the Philippines is revised, and two new species are described. Sundathelphusa philippina sensu stricto is here restricted to the Bicol Peninsula of southern Luzon, and to the islands of Samar and Leyte. It is one of the largest freshwater crabs in the archipelago, reaching carapace widths of more than 53 mm. Sundathelphusa cebu sp. nov. from Cebu Island is superficially similar to S. philippina in morphology but can be separated by a suite of carapace characters. Sundathelphusa quirino sp. nov. from northern Luzon is the most distinct of the three taxa, with a distinctly more swollen carapace, relatively wider male pleon and a straighter male first gonopod. Sundathelphusa spelaeophila Stasolla, Abbarchi & Innocenti, 2015, is also shown to be a junior synonym of S. philippina sensu stricto.

A total of 12 dry and seven live specimens of Macrochlamys leggeae sp. nov. were collected from the high-altitude region of Valley of Flowers National Park and are described here as a new species based on morph-taxonomy, conchological differences, and characters of the radula and genitalia. Collected specimens were compared with the closely related species Macrochlamys nuda (Pfeiffer, 1852), Macrochlamys vesicula (Benson, 1838), Macrochlamys glauca (Pfeiffer, 1846) and Macrochlamys kuluensis Blanford, 1904 and found to be significantly different in morphometric characters and in shell ratio. Additionally, high-resolution scanning electron microscope images of the radula with rechidian teeth measurements and a detailed description of the genitalia of M. leggeae are included. The new species is named after Joan Margaret Legge, Botanist of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, who lost her life during floral study in the Valley of Flowers National Park in 1939.

Until now, this species was thought to have a wide distribution in Polynesia. Numerous specimens identified as C. weberi were collected recently from various Polynesian islands. In the context of integrative taxonomy, they were morphologically and genetically studied. Three new species allied to C. weberi are here described: C. marquesensis n. sp., C. futunensis n. sp. and C. tupaia n. sp. The occurrence of C. rapaensis, another species part of the 'C. weberi' complex is confirmed.

This new species was found in very high densities, exclusively in gravelly sand deposited manually, and was not found in the original source habitat of the gravel. This species is characterized by the colour of the ventral shields with pinkish anterior part and a blood red posterior part in live specimens, a pair of unequal-sized plumose branchiae inserted on segment II and anterior thoracic neuropodia with long-handled uncini. The presence of long-handled uncini even in the smallest specimens constitutes the major difference between Pista colini sp. n. and other Pista species with a single pair of branchiae such as P. lornensis and P. bansei.

With 21 described species, Hexanchorus represents one of the most speciose Larainae genera, but its real diversity is likely much higher. We analysed material from a relatively small area in Ecuador, resulting in the first record of H. cordillierae for Ecuador and discovery of four new species and one subspecies: Hexanchorus virilis sp. n., Hexanchorus rostratus sp. n., Hexanchorus shepardi sp. n., Hexanchorus onorei sp. n. and Hexanchorus onorei sagittatus ssp. n.

Five new species of Rohrthrips (Thysanoptera: Rohrthripidae) from Burmese amber, and the evolution of Tubulifera wings	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Burmite; Cenomanian; new species; Rohrthrips; Rohrthripidae; Thysanoptera; Tubulifera; wing evolution	THRIPS; FAMILIES	Rohrthripidae is a family of fossil thrips in the thysanopteran suborder Tubulifera. It includes a single genus, Rohrthrips, of which two species are previously known. Despite typical tubuliferan features, these thrips also show some terebrantian character states, particularly in the wings and antennae, and these are here interpreted as plesiomorphic. Five new species of these ancestral thrips are described from Burmese Cenomanian amber: Rohrthrips breviceps sp. n., Rohrthrips jiewenae sp. n., Rohrthrips maryae sp. n., Rohrthrips patrickmuelleri sp. n. and Rohrthrips schizovenatus sp. n.. Structures on the wings support the conclusion that the wings of Tubulifera are homologous with those of Terebrantia. Syninclusions in the amber fragments provide evidence of the diet and habitats of these ancestral thrips.

The group was recovered as sister taxon to all remaining Schizopteridae in recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. Described species diversity of Hypselosomatinae (13 extant genera prior to this study) is greatest in the Old World and in particular the Australian region, while only five monotypic or small genera are currently described from the New World (Glyptocombus Heidemann, Ommatides Uhler, Williamsocoris Carpintero & Dellape, Hypsohapsis Hoey-Chamberlain & Weirauch, and Hypselosomops Hoey-Chamberlain & Weirauch). Based on examination of 60 specimens of Hypselosomatinae from South America, we here synonymize Ommatides that includes one described species from the Lesser Antilles with the monotypic genus Williamsocoris Carpintero & Dellape from Argentina, describe seven new species of Ommatides (O. duodentis sp. nov.,O. nudus sp. nov.,O. parvidentis sp. nov.,O. pillcopata sp. nov.,O. pristis sp. nov.,O. tridentis sp. nov.,O. yoderi sp. nov. and O. zanderij sp. nov.) from various locations in South America, and redescribe Ommatides.

This new species is most similar to P japonicus (McLachlan) and differs by the form of the male antenna and genitalia. Parachauliodes is primarily characterized by the "bilobed" ectoproct of male genitalia and by the serrate antenna of both sexes. In the new species, the male ectoproct is bilobed, but sexual dimorphism in the antennae is present. The male antenna of the new species is pectinate with short branches and the female antenna is serrate. Accordingly, including the new species P rastellus, the antennae of Parachauliodes can either be serrate or pectinate with short branches in the male, serrate in the female. The types of "Parachauliodes" buchi Navas are illustrated. A brief description of copulation, oviposition, eggs and hatching for the new species is also given.

Systematics of the palisade trapdoor spiders (Euoplos) of south-eastern Queensland (Araneae:Mygalomorphae:Idiopidae): four new species distinguished by their burrow entrance architecture	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						Arachnida; Arbanitinae; Australia; phylogeny	GENUS ALIATYPUS ARANEAE; NICHE CONSERVATISM; MYGALOMORPHAE; AUSTRALIA; IDIOPIDAE; DIVERSIFICATION; ECOLOGY; FAUNA	Within the spiny trapdoor spider genus Euoplos Rainbow exists a group of species from south-eastern Queensland that create unusual palisade' burrow entrances. Despite their intriguing burrows, the group was only recently circumscribed, and all species within it were undescribed. In this study, by undertaking a molecular phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial markers and seven nuclear markers, we confirm that the palisade trapdoor spiders, here formally named the turrificus-group', are monophyletic. We further recognise four species based on morphological, molecular and behavioural characters: E. crenatus, sp. nov., E. goomboorian, sp. nov., E. thynnearum, sp. nov. and E. turrificus, sp. nov. Morphological taxonomic data for each species are presented alongside information on their distribution, habitat preferences and burrow architecture. A key to species within the turrificus-group is also provided. The unusual burrow entrances of these spiders, which project out from the surrounding substrate, are found to exhibit structural autapomorphies, which allow species-level identification. Consequently, we include features of burrow architecture in our key and species diagnoses. This provides a non-intrusive method for distinguishing species in the field. Finally, we conclude that all species within the turrificus-group are likely to represent short-range endemic taxa. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:F2E042DC-DA14-4751-A48B-A367ABC272D9	[Wilson, Jeremy D.; Schmidt, Daniel J.; Hughes, Jane M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Rix, Michael G.; Raven, Robert J.] Queensland Museum, Biodivers & Geosci Program, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia	Wilson, JD (reprint author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.	jeremy.wilson@griffithuni.edu.au			Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) grant [RF215-06]	We would like to thank Kelvin and Amelia Nielsen, who were involved in the initial discovery of Euoplos crenatus, and kindly accompanied JDW back to the type (and only known) locality of this remarkable species to collect specimens and photograph burrows.

J	Cassis, G; Symonds, C; Branson, L				Cassis, Gerasimos; Symonds, Celia; Branson, Lauren			Systematics and species radiation of the sheoak lace bug genus Epimixia Kirkaldy (Insecta:Heteroptera:Tingidae) in Australia, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						biogeography; host plants; phylogeny; taxonomy	HEMIPTERA HETEROPTERA TINGIDAE; PLANT BUGS; ASSOCIATIONS; NOV	On the basis of new survey, knowledge of Australia's heteropteran fauna has been shown to have a significant taxonomic impediment, requiring the description of many new lineages. In this work we provide a monographic treatment of the lace bug genus Epimixia, including a phylogenetic analysis validating its monophyly. We redescribe the genus and previously described species E. alitophrosyne Kirkaldy, E. nigriceps (Signoret), E. nigripes dysmica Drake & Ruhoff, E. nigripes nigripes (Horvath), E. veteris Drake, E. vittata Horvath and E. vulturna (Kirkaldy). Eighteen new species are described, including the first recorded species from Papua New Guinea (E. gagnei, sp. nov.), a second species from New Caledonia (E. fulva, sp. nov.) and 16 new Australian species (E. aboccidente, sp. nov., E. acclivis, sp. nov., E. albimons, sp. nov., E. allocasuarina, sp. nov., E. bicolor, sp. nov., E. caerulamons, sp. nov., E. christopherdarwini, sp. nov., E. eneabba, sp. nov., E. kimberley, sp. nov., E. leai, sp. nov., E. megacosta, sp. nov., E. minor, sp. nov., E. pilbara, sp. nov., E. schuhi, sp. nov., E. tropica, sp. nov. and E. verticordiaphila, sp. nov.). Epimixia dysmica Drake & Ruhoff is elevated to species rank, from its previous subspeciefic status within E. nigripes. This work also reports host plants for Epimixia, predominantly belonging to the Casuarinaceae, with a handful of species associated with the Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Fabaceae. Host plants are mapped to the Epimixia phylogeny, indicating that the Casuarinaceae-affiliated Epimixia species form a subclade. Area relationships of the Epimixia species are analysed using subtree analysis, resulting in the south-west and south-east corners of Australia being sisters, relative to the Adelaide subregion, and in turn to Atherton + New Caledonia. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:E7FC4E37-517D-4AB7-A918-B9104D63AB25	[Cassis, Gerasimos; Symonds, Celia] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cassis, Gerasimos] Australian Museum, 1 Coll St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia	Cassis, G (reprint author), Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Cassis, G (reprint author), Australian Museum, 1 Coll St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.	gcassis@unsw.edu.au			ABRS Bush Blitz grants; Hermon Slade Foundation	This work was commenced at the Australian Museum under an Australian Biological Resources grant, which was subsequently transferred to the University of New South Wales.

Here we integrate data of morphology, cytology, microbiology, ecology, reproduction, and mitochondrial cox-1 and cob gene sequences to resolve a complex of sympatric species of Plakina in South-eastern Brazil. All datasets congruently supported the delimitation of three species, two of which are new to science. Plakina coerulea has its distribution extended from one locality to over 2360 km wide. Plakina cabofriense, sp. nov. also occurs in North-eastern Brazil. Plakina cyanorosea, sp. nov. occurs only in a single, small tide pool and may be critically endangered. Plakina cyanorosea, sp. nov. produces conspicuous, abundant larvae useful for laboratory investigations. A thin, bright orange organic coat covers some spicules of P. cabofriense, sp. nov. and P. cyanorosea, sp. nov. The three Plakina species harbour diverse microbial symbiont communities, including previously unknown morphologies. Molecular phylogenies and barcoding gaps based on cox-1 and cob sequences supported that each species is monophyletic and distinct from other congeners. The genus Plakina is paraphyletic and strongly needs redefinition. The integrative approach provides new data that widens our knowledge of Homoscleromorpha diversity, distribution and biology.

They are characterised by a distinctive bulbous carapace and a specialised foraging behaviour: preying on other orb-weavers. Chorizopes casictones, sp. nov. (Araneae, Araneidae) is described based on specimens collected in northern Madagascar. This species represents the third member of Chorizopes known from the island. We conducted a total-evidence analysis based on morphology, behaviour and nucleotide sequence data, including this taxon for the first time. The palpal morphology of the male of Chorizopes is illustrated in detail. We discuss the palpal homologies and the evolution of araneid palpal sclerites based on the newly inferred family phylogenetic tree.

A revision of the endemic South African long-jawed ground spider genus Drassodella Hewitt, 1916 (Araneae: Gallieniellidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						genitalia; new species; species group; Afrotropical; biome; biogeography	FAMILY; GNAPHOSOIDEA; EVOLUTION; FEMALE	The genus Drassodella Hewitt, 1916 is one of four Afrotropical genera of Gallieniellidae, and is presently represented by seven species, all endemic to South Africa. The type material of six of the described species was studied and they are redescribed from both sexes: D. melana Tucker, 1923, D. quinquelabecula Tucker, 1923, D. salisburyi Hewitt, 1916, D. septemmaculata (Strand, 1909), D. tenebrosa Lawrence, 1938 and D. vasivulva Tucker, 1923. Of these, the males of D. melana, D. tenebrosa and D. vasivulva are described for the first time. Recent field work yielded additional females of D. purcelli Tucker, 1923 from the vicinity of the type locality, and this sex is redescribed; the male remains unknown. A further 12 new species are recognized: D. amatola sp. nov. (female male), D. aurostriata sp. nov. (female male), D. baviaans sp. nov. (male), D. flava sp. nov. (female male), D. guttata sp. nov. (female male), D. lotzi sp. nov. (female), D. maculata sp. nov. (female), D. montana sp. nov. (female male), D. tolkieni sp. nov. (female male), D. trilineata sp. nov. (female), D. transversa sp. nov. (female male) and D. venda sp. nov. (female male). Based on the genitalic structures, there appear to be two distinct species groups. The D. melana species group, which includes D. melana, D. tenebrosa and eight new species mainly distributed in eastern and northern South Africa, is characterised by very conservative genitalic morphology in both sexes. The D. salisburyi species group, with considerable variation in the structure of the copulatory organs and distributed in the southern half of South Africa, includes the remaining nine species, of which four are new. Although D. tenebrosa represents an intermediate between the two groups, with palpal morphology more typical of the D. melana species group and epigynal morphology typical of the D. salisburyigroup, it is placed in the former species group based on its distribution in eastern South Africa. The biology, habitat preferences and biogeography of Drassodella are briefly discussed.

This systematic review provides for each genus: a historical background, an updated diagnosis and a list of species. Our review recognizes 37 valid genera, 395 valid species, 57 descriptions without enough morphological information for accurate identification (species inquirenda) and 10 species incerta sedis. We also recognize 21 species as nomena nuda. Additionally, polytomous keys were con structed for the subfamilies and for the genera of the three major subfamilies (Chromadorinae, Euchromadorinae and Hypodontolaiminae) using the most important diagnostic characters. A phylogenetic analysis based on rDNA sequences of species available in the GenBank was also conducted. Phylogenetic trees based on the 18S and 28S rDNA confirmed the classification into three subfamilies (Spilipherinae, Hypodontolaiminae and Chromadorinae), despite the absence of defined synapomorphies. Phylogenetic relationships at lower taxonomic level are problematic given the large number of sequences not identified to species level.

J	Boxshall, GA; O'Reilly, M; Sikorski, A; Summerfield, R				Boxshall, Geoff A.; O'Reilly, Myles; Sikorski, Andrey; Summerfield, Rebecca			Mesoparasitic copepods (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) associated with polychaete worms in European seas	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						parasitic copepod; polychaete host; new genera; new species; taxonomy	XENOCOELOMA ALLENI BRUMPT; HERPYLLOBIUS STEENSTRUP; TEREBELLIDES POLYCHAETA; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; PARASITIC COPEPODA; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; HOST POLYCIRRUS; TRICHOBRANCHIDAE; SABELLIDAE; CRUSTACEA	A large collection of mesoparasitic copepods from polychaete hosts collected in northern European waters was examined. The term mesoparasitic refers to highly transformed copepods where the adult female attaches by embedding part of its body in the host. Representatives of five known familes were found and a new family is established. A single new species, Bradophila minuta sp. nov., was described in the family Bradophilidae. It occurred exclusively on the flabelligerid Diplocirus glaucus (Malmgren, 1867). Two genera of the family Herpyllobiidae were represented: Herpyllobius Steenstrup & Lutken, 1861 and Eurysilenium M. Sars, 1870. Herpyllobius arcticus Steenstrup & Lutken, 1861 was found on at least five different polynoid hosts, two of which, Harmothoe fragilis Moore, 1910 and Antinoe sp., were new host records. A new species, H. cluthensis sp. nov. was described from Malmgrenia species in Scottish waters. The large species, Herpyllobius cordiformis Lutzen, 1964, was collected in Arctic waters from Eunoe cf. oerstedi. It is the first report of this parasite in Europe. The common parasite H. polynoes (Kroyer, 1864) was found on six different polynoid hosts, three of which, Harmothoe bifera, Malmgreniella mcintoshi Tebble & Chambers, 1982 and Eunoe ? barbata are new host records. Eurysilenium truncatum M. Sars, 1870 was collected from Eucranta villosa Malmgren, 1866, Eunone sp., and Gattyana cirrhosa (Pallas, 1766). The material from Eucranta villosa caught at 72.6 degrees N comprises both a new host record and is the most northerly report of this parasite. Specimens of Eurysilenium which differed from E. truncatum in a number of features were found on Harmothoe fragilis and H. impar (Johnston, 1839). A new family, the Pholoicolidae, is established to accommodate Pholicola chambersae gen. et sp. nov., parasitic on Pholoe pallida Chambers, 1985. The family Phyllodicolidae was represented by all three of its known species: Phyllodicola petiti (Delamare Deboutteville & Laubier, 1960), Cyclorhiza eteonicola Heegaard, 1942 and C. megalova Gotto & Leahy, 1988. The former was found on Eumida ockelmanni Eibye-Jacobsen, 1987, a new host record. A single ovigerous female of C. eteonicola was collected from a new host, Eteone spetsbergensis Malmgren, 1865. Cyclorhiza megalova was common on Eteone longa (Fabricius, 1780) and E. longa/ flava complex. A rich diversity of members of the family Saccopsidae was found, including three known species of Melinnacheres M. Sars, 1870 plus nine new species placed in four new genera. Melinnacheres was represented by M. ergasiloides M. Sars, 1870, M. steenstrupi Bresciani & Lutzen, 1961 and M. terebellidis Levinsen, 1878. Melinnacheres ergasiloides was found on Melinna elizabethae McIntosh, 1914, M. steenstrupi on members of the Terebellides stroemi-complex and T. atlantis Williams, 1984, while M. terebellidis was found on the T. stroemi-complex and on T. shetlandica Parapar, Moreira & O'Reilly, 2016. A new genus, Trichobranchicola gen. nov., was established to accommodate T. antennatus gen. et sp. nov., a parasite of Trichobranchus sikorskii Leontovich & Jirkov in Jirkov, 2001, T. glacialisMalmgren, 1866 and Trichobranchus sp. The second new genus, Lanassicola gen. nov., was established to accommodate the type species, Lanassicola arcticus gen. et sp. nov. parasitic on Lanassa venusta (Malm, 1874), plus two additional species, L. bilobatus gen. et sp. nov. on Lanassa nordenskjoeldi Malmgren, 1866, and L. dorsilobatus gen. et sp. nov. on Proclea graffii (Langerhans, 1884). A new subfamily, Euchonicolinae, was established within the Saccopsidae to accommodate two new genera, Euchonicola gen. nov. and Euchonicoloides gen. nov. The type species of Euchonicola gen. nov. is E. caudatus gen. et sp. nov., a parasite of Euchone sp., and it includes two other species, E. linearis gen. et sp. nov. on Chone sp., and E. parvus gen. et sp. nov. on Euchone sp. The type species of Euchonicoloides gen. nov. is E. elongatusgen. et sp. nov. found on a host belonging to the genus Euchone, and it also includes Euchonicoloides halli gen. et sp. nov. from Jasmineira caudata Langerhans, 1880. Four species of the family Xenocoelomidae were found: Xenocoelomaalleni (Brumpt, 1897), X. brumpti Caullery & Mesnil, 1915, X. orbicularis sp. nov. and Aphanodomus terebellae (Levinsen, 1878). Xenocoeloma alleni was found on four different species of Polycirrus and on Amaeana trilobata (M. Sars, 1863) and X. brumpti was found on Polycirrus norvegicus Wollebaek, 1912. Xenocoeloma orbicularis sp. nov. occurred only on Paramphitrite birulai (Ssolowiew, 1899). Aphanodomus terebellae was found on three hosts, only one of which, Leaena abranchiata was new.

Revision of world Sphecomyia Latreille (Diptera, Syrphidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Criorhina; description; DNA barcode; flower fly; hoverfly; identification key; new species; species group; taxonomy	AMPLIFICATION; CHROMOSOMES; PRIMERS	The 16 world species of Sphecomyia Latreille are revised, including seven previously undescribed species (S. cryptica Moran, sp. n., S. hoguei Moran, sp. n., S. interrupta Moran, sp. n., S. oraria Moran, sp. n., S. pseudosphecomima Moran, sp. n., S. sexfasciata Moran, sp. n., and S. weismani Moran, sp. n.). Descriptions, redescriptions, male genitalia photographs, distribution maps, and an illustrated key for all Sphecomyia are presented. DNA barcode data are provided for all 16 species with a cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene tree presented and discussed. Sphecomyia stat. rev. is redefined to represent the monophyletic lineage of species within subtribe Criorhinina possessing a bare, medial vitta extending ventrally from the oral margin in both sexes, a bare gena, a bare katepimeron, a scutellum with at least anterior margin densely pruinose, an anterior ventral half of vein C before crossvein h without setae, and a narrow intersection of vein R-1 with vein C. Three species groups of Sphecomyia are identified: the S. vittata group which possess pruinose scutellar vittae, the S. pattonii group which lack pruinose scutellar vittae, and S. metallica (Bigot), a hairy bee mimic with a completely pruinose scutum. Criorhina tsherepanovi Violovitsh is resurrected and transferred, along with Criorhina aino Stackelberg, to the genus Sphecomyia: S. tsherepanovi (Violovitsh), comb. n. and S. aino (Stackelberg), comb. n. Criorhina metallica (Bigot) is designated as the senior synonym of C. lupina (Williston), not junior as improperly treated, and transferred to Sphecomyia: S. metallica (Bigot), comb. n. The species Sphecomyia fusca Weisman, S. nasica Osburn, and S. occidentalis Osburn are transferred to Criorhina Meigen: C. fusca (Weisman), comb. n., C. nasica (Osburn), comb. n., and C. occidentalis (Osburn), comb. n.

Using a combination of genetic and morphological evidence, Anagrus (Anagrus) rugmanjonesi Triapitsyn & Adachi-Hagimori, sp. n., is described and illustrated. It is shown to be different from the most similar A. turpanicus Triapitsyn & Hu, an egg parasitoid of a leafhopper pest of cultivated grapes which is known from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China. Mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence data provide clear evidence for the separation of A. rugmanjonesi from A. turpanicus and other members of the Anagrus incarnatus Haliday species complex. A key to females of the Japanese species of Anagrus Haliday is given. Two other species of Mymaridae, Arescon enocki (Subba Rao & Kaur) and Stethynium empoascae Subba Rao, are also identified, albeit the latter one only tentatively. Both latter taxa are newly recorded from Japan, and E. onukii represents their new host association.

In order to examine the monophyly of Emphylica, and its relationship to other genera with a conical frons, a molecular phylogenetic framework is reconstructed based on sequence data of COI, 16S rRNA, 28S rRNA, EF-1 alpha and Wg gene regions. The results robustly support the monophyly of Emphylica. Achyra + (Loxostege + Sitochroa) is in a sister position to Emphylica. A new species, E. crassihamata sp. n., is described from Southern China and two new combinations, E. diaphana (Caradja & Meyrick, 1934), comb. n. and E. cruoralis (Warren, 1895), comb. n., are proposed.

Osteology and systematics of Uberabatitan ribeiroi (Dinosauria; Sauropoda): a Late Cretaceous titanosaur from Minas Gerais, Brazil	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Titanosauriformes; Titanosauria; Phylogeny; South America; Bauru Basin	BAURU GROUP; SP-NOV.; PATAGONIA; NEUQUENSAURUS; PERSPECTIVE; PHYLOGENY; SKELETON; MENDOZA; SERIES; GEN.	Uberabatitan ribeiroi is a Late Cretaceous titanosaur (Dinosauria, Sauropoda) from southeastern Brazil. Here we provide a detailed revision of all its available specimens, including new elements from the type-locality. One new autopomorphy is added to diagnosis of the taxon: astragalus with a well-developed anteroposterior crest that mediodistally delimits the tibial articulation. Linear regressions were conducted in an attempt to circumscribe specimens within the type-series, revealing that it is composed of several individuals, with inferred total body lengths varying from 7 to 26 meters. Phylogenetic analyses including U. ribeiroi show that the Brazilian taxon corresponds to a non-saltasaurid lithostrotian titanosaur.	[Silva Junior, Julian C.

Analysis of recently collected material has confirmed both populations are specifically distinct to the type population, with one being more closely related to Lerista ameles Greer, 1979, another little known, north Queensland species. Consequently, these populations are described as Lerista alia sp. nov. and Lerista parameles sp. nov. The morphological diversity of L. storri is thereby restricted, necessitating a redescription. The conservation status of all these taxa is discussed.

A new species of Omolicna (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha: Fulgoroidea: Derbidae) from coconut palm in Costa Rica and new country records for Omolicna brunnea and Omolicna triata	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Derbidae; Cenchreini; new species; Costa Rica; planthopper; survey; genetic diversity	PHYTOPLASMAS; VECTORS; FLORIDA	An ongoing survey for novel phytoplasmas and viruses that affect palms (Arecaceae) is being conducted in Costa Rica along with potential vectors. During that survey, a new species of derbid planthopper (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea) in the genus Omolicna Fennah was detected from Heredia and Limon State and is here described as Omolicna xavieri sp. n. This new taxon was first found on declining coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) and subsequently on healthy coconut palms in Tortuguero National Park. Also, two additional species of Omolicna, O. brunnea and O. triata, were collected on coconut in the same habitat and represent new country records. There are no previously published records of Omolicna from Costa Rica. Sequence data for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the 18S ribosomal RNA gene were obtained. In addition, novel 18S primers specific to auchenorrhynchan insects were developed and presented. The molecular data show high pairwise distances between O. xavieri sp. n. and other Omolicna species (24% to 31% and 10% using COI and 18S, respectively). Based on both morphological and sequence data, we erect and briefly describe the new subgenus Agoo for the new species to reflect the observed differences. A checklist of Omolicna species is presented.

The new species induces galls on Quercus bumelioides Liebm. and Q. insignis M. Martens & Galeotti (Fagaceae, sect. Quercus) and is the first species of the genus Andricus 'sensu lato' recorded from Panama. Andricus barriosi is part of a species complex that includes A. nievesaldreyi Pujade-Villar, A. georgei Pujade-Villar and A. maesi Pujade-Villar which differ from the other species of the genus Andricus by having a characteristic striate-reticulate sculpture on the second metasomal tergum that is typically smooth in the other Andricus species. The diagnostic characters, gall description, distribution and biological data of the new species are given, and a key for the differentiation of the new species from related species is also provided.

Sars, 1851 (Annelida, Capitellidae) and the description of a new species from the Gulf of California	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Capitellids; checklist; Gulf of California	POLYCHAETA; COAST; FAUNA	Capitellids are burrowing, earthworm-like polychaetes. The taxonomy within the group presents significant difficulties, due in part to their relative simplicity. In this study, a catalogue of the capitellid genus Notomastus M. Sars, 1851, is presented and a new species is described from the Southern Gulf of California: Notomastus mazatlanensis sp. nov. The catalogue provides original names and synonymies for 43 species; type locality and location of type materials; records and remarks on systematics and distribution. Type material of 35 species were examined, 31 from which were photographed to illustrate the catalogue. Notomastus mazatlanensis sp. nov. is established based on the presence of finger-like branchiae emerging from the epithelium near to the notopodia. Branchiae are composed by 3-4 filaments, and the first chaetiger is uniramous. A taxonomic key for species distributed in the Gulf of California is presented.

Cyrtodactylus nyinyikyawi sp. nov. from the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Magway Region in the east and C. pyadalinensis sp. nov. from the Panluang-Pyadalin Wildlife Sanctuary, Shan State in the west bear unique suits of morphological and color pattern character states separating them from all species in the peguensis group. Additionally, a molecular phylogeny based on the mitochondrial gene ND2 indicates that neither species is nested within, nor sister to any known species in the group. This study augments recent and ongoing studies showing that the Ayeyarwady Basin is herpetologically more diverse than previously considered and should be incorporated into ongoing discussions concerning conservation efforts in Myanmar.

Songs are specific among species,. this depending on physiology and the structural characteristics of the forewings. Nevertheless, some species belonging to subfamily Gryllinae have lost their singing abilities (mute species). Chinese examples include Agryllus spp., Conoblemmus spp., Goniogryllus spp. and Callogryllus yunnanus. Males of these genera are either wingless or have forwings similar to those of females.

Phylogenetic analyses recover H. indosobrinus sp. nov. from Champasak Province as the sister lineage to the Thai endemic H. flaviventris. Hemiphyllodactylus indosobrinus sp. nov. can be diagnosed by having 15 supralabial scales, eight chin scales, 4-5-5-4 subdigital lamellae on Fingers II-V, 4-5-5-5 subdigital lamellae on Toes II-V, and 18 continuous precloacofemoral pores. Phylogenetic analyses recover H. serpispecus sp. nov. from Houaphanh Province to be most closely related to the Vietnamese endemic H. banaensis. Hemiphyllodactylus serpispecus sp. nov. differs from congeners by having seven chin scales; 3-4-4-4 subdigital lamellae on Fingers II-V; 3-4-4-5 subdigital lamellae on Toes II-V; and 11 continuous precloacofemoral pores. The recognition of these two new species doubles the number of Hemiphyllodactylus known from Laos.

(Fabaceae) was discovered in Siberia. Here, this taxon is described as Phyllonorycter ivani sp. n. Among Fabaceae-feeding Phyllonorycter, so far only P. caraganella (Ermolaev) has been known to develop on Caragana. Phyllonorycter ivani and P. caraganella show a large divergence in morphology (external and male genitalia) and barcode region of the mtDNA-COI gene (8.6%). They feed on different host plants species and have different ranges in Russia. We show that DNA barcode data weakly supports the Fabaceae-feeding species groups. In addition, we show that morphologically (strongly) and genetically (weakly), P. ivani has affinity to the haasi species group, a West Palearctic group with asymmetrical male genitalia.

Re-evaluation of Zospeum schaufussi von Frauenfeld, 1862 and Z-suarezi Gittenberger, 1980, including the description of two new Iberian species using Computer Tomography (CT) (Eupulmonata, Ellobioidea, Carychiidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Cave-dwelling species; microgastropods; shell variability; subterranean land snail		The present study aims to clarify the confused taxonomy of Z. schaufussi von Frauenfeld, 1862 and Zospeum suarezi Gittenberger, 1980. Revision of Iberian Zospeum micro snails is severely hindered by uncertainties regarding the identity of the oldest Iberian Zospeum species, Z. schaufussi von Frauenfeld, 1862. In this paper, we clarify its taxonomic status by designating a lectotype from the original syntype series and by describing its internal and external shell morphology. Using SEM-EDX, we attempt to identify the area of the type locality cave more precisely than "a cave in Spain". The shell described and illustrated by Gittenberger (1980) as Z. schaufussi appears not to be conspecific with the lectotype shell, and is considered a separate species, Z. gittenbergeri Jochum, Prieto & De Winter, sp. n. Zospeum suarezi was described from various caves in NW Spain. Study of the type material reveals that these shells are not homogenous in shell morphology. The holotype shell of Z. suarezi is imaged here for the first time. The paratype shell, illustrated by Gittenberger (1980) from a distant, second cave, is described as Zospeum praetermissum Jochum, Prieto & De Winter, sp. n. The shell selected here as lectotype of Z. schaufussi, was also considered a paratype of Z. suarezi by Gittenberger (1980). Since this specimen is morphologically very similar to topotypic shells of Z. suarezi, the latter species is considered a junior synonym of Z. schaufussi (syn. n.). The internal shell morphology of all these taxa is described and illustrated using X-ray Micro Computer Tomography (Micro-CT).

Prognathodes geminus, a new species of butterflyfish (Teleostei, Chaetodontidae) from Palau	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Closed-circuit rebreather; Mesophotic Coral Ecosystem; Micronesia; systematic ichthyology	BIOGEOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; TAXONOMY; DNA	A new species of the butterflyfish genus Prognathodes (Chaetodontidae) is described from two specimens collected at a depth of 116 m off Ngemelis Island, Palau. Prognathodes geminus sp. n. is similar to P. basabei Pyle & Kosaki, 2016 from the Hawaiian archipelago, and P. guezei (Mauge & Bauchot, 1976) from the western Indian Ocean, but differs from these species in the number of soft dorsal-fin rays, size of head, body width, and body depth. There are also subtle differences in life color, and substantial differences in the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I sequence (d approximate to 0.08). Although genetic comparisons with P. guezei are unavailable, it is expected that the genetic divergence between P. guezei and P. geminus will be even greater than that between P. geminus and P. basabei. It is named for the strikingly similar color pattern it shares with P. basabei.

(holotype male in MNRJ: Brazil, Minas Gerais State), a new gall midge species causing leaf galls on Banisteriopsis membranifolia (A. Juss.) B. Gates (Malpighiaceae), an endemic liana in Brazil, is described based on larva, pupa, adult male and female and its gall is characterized. Galls were collected in Quartel de Sao Joao, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. Larvae were removed from the galls and pupae and adults were obtained by rearing. Pupation takes place in the gall. The most important morphological characters were illustrated. The new species is compared with other Neotropical species of Clinodiplosis and belongs to the group with simple tarsal claws, curved beyond tarsus midlength. Clinodiplosis quartelensis sp. nov. shares the male cercus secondarily lobed, the 12th female flagellomere with setulose apical process, the deeply bilobed male hypoproct with convergent lobes, pupa lacking dorsal spines on abdominal segments, and larva with four pairs of setose terminal papillae with C. bellum from that might be distinguished by size of palpus, wing venation, level of sclerotization of eighth abdominal segment in the adults, as well as, by the pupal cephalic dorsal plate and larval spatula.

The Calypso hydrothermal vent field is dominated by the chalinid sponge Haliclona (Soestella) battershilli sp. nov., a large, cream-coloured, finely branched species, and the less common H. (Halichoclona) sonnae sp. nov., an encrusting, translucent white, cushion-shaped species. The third species, the suberitid sponge Protosuberites novaezelandiae sp. nov., forms encrustations with digitate projections. Haliclona (Halichoclona) sonnae sp. nov. and Protosuberites novaezelandiae sp. nov. represent new subgenus and genus records, respectively, for New Zealand waters. The methanotrophic suberitid sponge, Pseudosuberites thurberi sp. nov., is found at many of the cold seep sites on the Hikurangi Margin where it forms extensive, encrusting to digitate mats. The description of these species provides a basis for the future study of the ecology of sponges that are apparently endemic to vent and seep habitats off New Zealand.

The new species differs from other described species of Cotithene by its integument color pattern dissimilar between sexes and by the procoxal cavities separated by only a narrow septum in both male and female. It furthers differs by the unique morphology of male and female genitalia. A previously published key and phylogenetic matrix to Cotithene species were each modified to include the new species. The historical trajectory of host associations (inflorescences of Cyclanthaceae) in Cotithene is reanalyzed with the inclusion of the host of the new species. Previously known species are believed to be non-pollinators of various Cyclanthaceae; however, field observations of adults of the new species on inflorescences in anthesis of Evodianthus funifer (Cyclanthaceae) strongly suggest that this may be the first species of Cotithene known to play a role as a pollinator of Cyclanthaceae.

(type species Tyrannothroscus rex n.sp.) and Pseudothroscus n. gen. (type species Pseudothroscus balticus n. sp.). Four species are described from Baltic amber: Tyrannothroscus rex n. sp., Pseudothroscus balticus n. sp., Potergus superbus n. sp. and Trixagus parvulus n. sp. Pactopus burmensis n. sp. is described from Burmese amber. A phylogenetic analysis of the known throscid genera is performed. Aulonothroscus Horn and Trixagus Kugelann are shown to be sister-groups, the sister-group of this Glade is the genus Pactopus Horn and the sister group of these three genera is the genus Potergus Bonvouloir. The oldest previously known throscids were species belonging to the genera Rhomboaspis Kirejtshuk & Kovalev and Potergosoma Kirejtshuk & Kovalev, both from Lebanese Amber, 125-135 Mya. The present analysis shows that the extinct Baltic amber genera Jaira Muona and Pseudothroscus belong to clades at least as old as the Lebanese fossils. The Burmese amber fossil Pactopus burmensis, 99 Mya, is considerably older than any of the previously known species belonging to the four extant genera: Pactopus,Potergus, Aulonothroscus or Trixagus. At least three throscid lineages are now known to have gone extinct. Both the Pactopus and Potergus lineages are more than 99 milion years old, whereas the Aulonothroscus and Trixagus lineages extend at least to the Baltic amber, 50 million years ago.

J	Kolicka, M				Kolicka, Malgorzata			Gastrotricha - not only in sediments: new epiphytic species of Chaetonotida from the Jubilee Greenhouse of the Botanical Garden in Krakow	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Alien species; Chaetonotus; new species; new records; palm house	FRESH-WATER; PALM HOUSE; 1ST RECORD; PHYLOGENY; LAKES; RISK	Although Gastrotricha have previously been recorded in bottom sediments of greenhouses as well as in micro-reservoirs of Bromeliaceae, palm houses provide a more specific microhabitat for these animals that often originate from different regions of the world. This paper presents an investigation of gastrotrich assemblages associated with aquatic plants. Eight species of the epiphytic chaetonotids were found in the Jubilee Greenhouse of the Botanical Garden in Krakow (Poland), including three species new to science, Chaetonotus (Chaetonotus) invitatus sp. nov., C. (Hystricochaetonotus) horridus sp. nov. and C. (H.) inaequabilis sp. nov. Two other species are new to Poland, C. (C.) paucisquamatus Kisielewski, 1991 and C. (Zonochaeta) cestacanthus Balsamo, 1990, both recorded here for the first time outside their terra typica. These observations confirm that greenhouses and palm houses provide many ecological niches and favourable conditions for the development of a number of unintentionally introduced species which cannot be found outside their original climate conditions.

This species co-occurs in the eastern sector of the northern Indian Ocean with two poorly defined congeners, R. annandalei Norman and R. lionotus Norman, which have been misidentified and confused with Indo-Pacific congeners since they were first described in 1926. Norman's species are rediagnosed based on limited new material and a re-examination of the types. In the western sector of the northern Indian Ocean, Rhinobatos annandalei has been confused in recent literature with the sympatric R. punctifer Compagno and Randall, which is represented by four primary colour morphs, including a white-spotted colour morph resembling R. annandalei. Rhinobatos punctifer also displays strong intraspecific variability and sexual dimorphism in some body dimensions. These four species of Rhinobatos have unique MtDna sequences and belong to a Glade of Indo-West Pacific species that are morphologically similar. Despite the relatively small numbers of specimens available for investigation, these species exhibit some clear differences in body proportions, meristics and squamation. Rhinobatos ranongensis sp. nov. differs from its northern Indian Ocean congeners through a combination of a relatively narrow disc and mouth, high vertebral count, long snout, low dorsal fins, and being largely plain coloured. A new lectotype and a paralectotype are designated for the syntypes of R. annandalei, and the four primary colour forms of R. punctifer, the plain, whites-potted and ocellated morphs, are described and the three nominal species rediagnosed. A key is provided to the four known members of the genus in the northern Indian Ocean.

The species shows some resemblance with the mecopteran family Bittacidae, mainly due to strongly elongated and thin legs. However, the structural affinities are apparently due to convergency. Different features, but especially the mouthparts and the pattern of wing venation, indicate that the species belongs to the extinct order t Permopsocida (?Archipsyllidae). However, it differs markedly from all species previously described in this extinct group. The very thin and strongly elongated legs are probably autapomorphic. A very unusual feature is the antenna with only seven segments and extremely elongated flagellomeres. The two pairs of wings are unusually narrow. M and CuA are basally fused. Proximal rows of spines, two series of closed cells, and a distinctly increased number of terminal branches of M are present in the forewings, in contrast to other archipsyllid genera. It is conceivable that Bittacopsocus megacephalus used its long legs to rest suspended in the vegetation like Bittacus. The head structures tentatively suggest predatory behavior but the feeding habits are unclarified yet.

J	Ryabinin, NA; Zaitsev, AS				Ryabinin, N. A.; Zaitsev, A. S.			TWO NEW ORIBATID SPECIES (ACARI, ORIBATIDA) FROM SAKHALIN ISLAND	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL			Russian	Article						beetle-mites; Oribatida; Xenillus; Lasiobelba; new species; Sakhalin Island		Descriptions of two new oribatid mite species found in the park zone of the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Sakhalin Island, Russia are provided. Xenillus similis sp. n. is a large light brown species in which the lamellae cover most of the proterosoma, the cusps are large, separate, knife-shaped with sharpened, diverging, medial teeth. The translamella is narrow with a tiny tooth between the cusps. The sensilla are fusiform. The new species is distinguished from the apparently most similar species X. sculptrus Kulijev 1963 by the thinner rostral and lamellar setae, the longer interlamellar setae and sensilla, the different shapes of the sensilla (fusiform, vs. clavate), lamellae (in X sculptrus they are broadened towards the anterior end) and cusps. The new species differs from. X tegeocranus (Hermann 1904) by the thin and poorly pubescent dorsal and ventral setae, the shorter lamellar setae, the longer and sparsely pubescent interlamellar setae, the fusiform sensilla (vs. clavate), and the shape of the cusps with more elongated internal teeth. Lasiobelba (Lasiobelba) sakhalinensis sp. n. is a middle-sized species in which the rostrum is slightly projected and rounded. Costulae are absent, prodorsal setae smooth, the sensilla fusiform without a spire on top. Ten pairs of notogastral setae are long and smooth (except for setae c which are represented by alveoli), p(1)-p(3) are shorter than the others. The anogenital setae are thin and smooth. The discidium is sharpened. Leg claws are thin. From the likewise morphologically similar L. (L.) remota Aoki 1959 and L. (L.) insulata Ohkubo 2001 the new species differs by the smaller size and fusiform sensilla without a spire on top (vs. both L. (L.) remota and L. (L.) insulata have long sensilla widened in the middle part with a spire on top), the shorter interlamellar setae (vs. they almost reach the insertion points of lamellar setae), and the smooth prodorsal and notogastral setae.

MYXOZOA; KUDOA-SEPTEMPUNCTATA; PARASITE; FISH; OSTEICHTHYES; MYXOSPOREA; PROTOZOA	Most species of Myxobolus (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) infect freshwater and marine fish, and cause sporozoosis. Passage of myxozoan parasites into human feces has been described occasionally. We examined fecal samples from 97 dwellers of a riverine community in Amazonas State (Brazil), which revealed Myxobolus sp. in 13 (13%) samples. The discovery probably does not represent true parasitism as the myxospores - most likely ingested through the consumption of infected fish - were eliminated unchanged after passing through the gastrointestinal tract. This discovery represents the first report of this myxosporean in human fecal samples in Brazil.

(Lampridiformes: Radiicephalidae), described from a single specimen collected off southwestern Taiwan, represents a formerly monotypic and rarely collected family, known almost entirely from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, although some unsupported larval records exist from the north and eastern Pacific oceans. Radiicephalus kessinger can be distinguished from the only other congener R. elongatus Osorio 1917 on the basis of fin ray and vertebral counts, fin ray positions and lengths, lateral line position, jaw shape, dorsal body outline and teeth patterns. The specimen represents the first record of the family in the western Pacific Ocean, there being no reliable records or voucher specimens of the family from the Indo-West Pacific region. New information is given on scales and coloration of R. elongatus, based on examination of the neotype and additional specimens.

The new species is distinguished from Epinephelus stictus (Randall and Allen 1987) with which it has historically been conflated, based on coloration, meristics, morphology, and genetics. Epinephelus craigi sp. nov. has a unique color pattern of irregular squarish, dark brown blotches interrupting lighter brown bars along the lateral midline of the body, and small dots on the dorsal surface of the body. Additionally, E. craigi sp. nov. has a longer upper jaw, shorter snout length, narrower interorbital width, and shorter caudal peduncle than E. stictus. Both E. stictus and the new species are relatively deep-water species, with the new species occurring to at least 93m. Epinephelus craigi sp. nov. is known from the South China Sea and E. stictus is known from Western Australia and southern Indonesia, suggesting allopatric and anti-equatorial distributions. DNA sequence divergence data of the mitochondrial COI gene further supports the distinction of E. craigi sp. nov. from E. stictus.	[Frable, Benjamin W.; Walker, H.

The new species resembles Ostorhinchus gularis (Fraser and Lachner 1984) and Ostorhinchus atrogaster (Smith and Radcliffe in Radcliffe 1912) in body coloration, lacking distinct stripes on the lateral surface and a distinct blotch on the caudal-fin base, but differs in having 24-28 (modally 26) developed gill rakers, 25-31 (modally 28) total gill rakers (including rudiments), the body depth 21.9-28.4% of SL (mean 24.1%) and upper-jaw length 12.3-15.5% (13.5%). Apogon smithvanizi Allen and Randall 1994 is reconfirmed as a junior synonym of O. gularis. Although the new species is superficially similar to a co-occurring species Rhabdamia gracilis (Bleeker 1856) in overall body appearance, numerous differences exist between the two species.

J	Fukui, Y				Fukui, Yoshino			Redescription of Iniistius jacksonensis (Ramsay 1881) and description of Iniistius opalus sp. nov. from northern Australia (Perciformes: Labridae)	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Wrasse; Morphology; New species; Distribution		The razorfish Iniistius jacksonensis (Ramsay 1881) is redescribed based on 10 specimens, including adult individuals, from eastern Australia. A second Australian species, Iniistius opalus sp. nov. is described based on 16 specimens from northern waters. Both species can be distinguished from other congeners in having a broad band of small scale rows on the cheek, a single small scale below the eye, first two dorsal-fin spines short, their length similar to those of other spines of dorsal fin, central gill-raker of lower limb of first gill arch with a single branch, greater body depth [33.6-41.5% standard length (SL) in Iniistius jacksonensis, versus 33.5-39.2% SL in I. opalus sp. nov.], and several small blotches on the anal-fin base. The new species can be distinguished from I. jacksonensis by its 10 scale rows below lateral line, four branches on central gill-raker of first upper limb of gill arch (vs. 2 branches in latter), greater head length [32.9-36.0% (mean 34.3%) vs. 29.6-32.1% (31.2%) SL], pre-pectoral-fin length [29.8-32.5% (31.2%) vs. 26.5-29.9% (28.5%) SL], orbit diameter [6.1-7.3% (6.8%) vs. 5.0-6.8% (5.8%) SL] and postorbital length [14.9-18.4% (16.8%) vs. 13.6-16.2% (14.9%) SL], and small blotches on head (vs. no blotches).

The new species is closely related to S. apiensis (Jordan and Seale 1906), which is redescribed, both species having a long upper jaw with the posterior tip slightly short of or just reaching to the posterior border of the preopercle; no predorsal scutes; the posterior preopercular border rounded and convex; the posterior tip of the depressed pelvic fin extending beyond a vertical through the dorsal-fin origin; no dark lines on the dorsum; and no black spots below the eye and lower-jaw tip. However, the new species is distinguished from S. apiensis in having lower total gill-raker counts on the first, second, third, and fourth gill arches (46-49, 36-41, 24-27, and 18-22, respectively, vs. 48-53, 40-47, 24-29, and 19-22), a deeper body (19.5-21.1% SL vs. 17.0-20.0%), shorter anal-fin base (19.0-20.1% SL vs. 20.2-23.3%), longer caudal peduncle (18.4-19.8% SL vs. 14.4-18.3%), and pairs of distinct dark patches on the parietal and occipital regions (patches obscure in S. apiensis).

The new species can be assigned to the superfamily Ryocalanoidea based on the segmentation and armature of the swimming legs and the modification of the male right antennule. A new interpretation of the fusions of segments in the male right antennule of Ryocalanus shows the marked differences between the ryocalanoidean genera. The status of Ryocalanoidea within the Calanoida is discussed based on morphology and a first molecular multi-gene analysis with cytochrome oxidase subunit I, cytochrome b, nuclear ribosomal 18S and 28S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer 2. This analysis supports the close interrelationship between Ryocalanoidea and Spinocalanoidea. The monophyletic status of Ryocalanoidea could not be retrieved in the phylogenetic analysis, as specimens of Yrocalanus formed a clade within Spinocalanoidea. The inconclusive results between morphological and molecular analyses are discussed with a proposition to keep the current system until more males of taxa belonging to the Spinocalanoidea are discovered, as the male antennule plays a crucial role in the interpretation of relationships between Ryocalanoidea and Spinocalanoidea.

Molecular phylogeny of Ateleutinae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae): systematics and biogeography of a widespread parasitoid wasp lineage	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Cryptinae; Psychidae; bagworm; parasite; Duwalia; Ateleute; Tamaulipeca	INSECTA HYMENOPTERA; ALIGNMENT; SEQUENCES; SELECTION; RDNA	The phylogeny of the ichneumonid parasitoid wasp subfamily Ateleutinae is investigated based on molecular data from five genes. A total of 36 species are included in the ingroup. Maximum likelihood analyses recovered a strongly supported monophyletic clade circumscribing the subfamily Ateleutinae. Five main clades were recovered in the subfamily, but relationships between these clades were mostly poorly supported. A new genus is identified and described: Duwalia Santos gen. nov. from Australia, which corresponds to the earliest known diverging lineage of Ateleutinae. Duwalia perula Santos sp. nov. is described and illustrated. The genus Ateleute is shown to be paraphyletic with respect to Tamaulipeca, but further studies with more intense sampling of the Neotropical fauna are needed in order to provide a comprehensive classification of the genera within this subfamily. Ateleute boitata Santos sp. nov., a morphologically aberrant species from South America, is described to highlight the morphological diversity in the genus. All Old World species of Ateleute are recovered in a single clade. Ateleute grossa is newly recorded as a parasitoid of Oiketicus kirbyi (Lepidoptera: Psychidae). Diagnoses and identification keys to the genera of Ateleutinae are provided.

Its type species Katara connexa sp. nov. (Diptera: Syrphidae) is described from the Pindos Mountains (Greece), and the systematic position of the monotypic taxon within the tribe Rhingiini is analysed using morphological and molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses resolved Katara connexa gen. et sp. nov. as sister taxon to Pelecocera latifrons. We assert based on the molecular phylogenetic results and the morphological distinctness of Pelecocera latifrons that this taxon merits a generic rank, thus we erect the genus Pseudopelecocera gen. nov. and also place Pelecocera persiana in this new genus based on shared characteristics. Based on our results, we place Chamaesyrphus in subgeneric rank and as a sister group to the nominal subgenus Pelecocera. We provide an identification key to the Rhingiini genera. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered all speciose Rhingiini genera as monophyletic and support existence of three main lineages within the tribe: (1) genus Rhingia with two groups, Palaearctic+Neotropical and Afrotropical taxa, (2) genus Cheilosia with its subgenera, and (3) lineage with remaining genera (Pseudopelecocera gen. nov., Katara gen. nov., Ferdinandea, Psarochilosia, Psarus, Portevinia and Pelecocera).

The population of J. planata is found to be restricted to inshore islands and the continental mainland coast of the tropical and subtropical Pacific coast of America. A new species, Johngarthia oceanica sp. nov., is described for populations that occur on the oceanic Clipperton and Socorro islands. Johngarthia oceanica sp. nov., can be separated from J. planata by the broad, subrectangular mesial lobe of the infraorbital margin (narrow, subtriangular in J. planata) and a dorsal carapace that is dark yellow to brightly orange with or without black areas of different extension (homogeneously red to maroon in J. planata). The distribution of J. planata is modeled using MaxEnt and the biogeography of East Pacific species of Johngarthia is discussed. The conservation status of the Clipperton population of J. oceanica sp. nov. deserves special attention because this population may be threatened by introduced rats.

AN ANATOMICAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF ITALIAN LIMAX (GASTROPODA: PULMONATA: LIMACIDAE)	JOURNAL OF CONCHOLOGY			English	Article						Limax cinereoniger; genital anatomy; Europe; Italy	N. SP; SLUG	An anatomical approach to the study of the slugs belonging to the genus Limax, based on the structures present in the inner walls of the penis, is proposed. These characteristics clearly allow the separation of the different species and they agree with the results obtained in genetic investigations. In this first contribution many populations of L. cinereoniger are reported from the north-eastern area of Italy (Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige and Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and compared with other European populations. The diagnostic characters of L. cinereoniger, such as the sole colour (blackish lateral bands), the comparatively elongate penis (42-159mm), first crest much longer than the second one and the low and very short second crest and pleat are discussed and compared with those of similar species.

The new species is distinguished by the evident apicodorsal trichostele on the last tibia of both sexes and the gonopodal telopodite being particularly complex, quadripartite, consisting of the longest, mesal, suberect solenomere branch; a slightly shorter, similarly slender, acuminate endomere branch tightly appressed to the solenomere; a somewhat shorter, caudal, strongly curved, armed exomere process; and a very distinct, low, lateral, sac-shaped velum at their base. This situation strongly resembles the one observed in the geographically closest C. perplexa Golovatch & VandenSpiegel, 2015, from Myanmar, but the shapes and armament of all outgrowths of the gonopodal telopodite are clearly different.

One of these populations was discovered at The Pinnacles, an isolated area of habitat in between the distributions of P. gulbaru and P. amnicola. Genetic and morphological data shows that this population is most similar to P. gulbaru Hoskin, Couper & Schneider, 2003 but divergent in a number of traits. Here we describe this population as a new species, P. pinnaclensis sp. nov., based on genetic divergence and differences in a number of morphometric and scalation traits from other populations of Phyllurus. Phyllurus pinnaclensis sp. nov. appears to be restricted to a few small areas of deeply layered rock with associated dry rainforest. This habitat is fire-sensitive and increased frequency and intensity of fires (due to late season burns and high fuel loads of invasive grasses) threatens to reduce and fragment these dry rainforest patches. Other threats include potential future invasion of the habitat by introduced Asian House Geckos (Hemidactylus frenatus Dumeril & Bibron, 1836) and illegal collecting. Given the very small and fragmented distribution and potential reduction in habitat area due to fire, P. pinnaclensis sp. nov. warrants a Critically Endangered listing. Resolving the distributional change of dry rainforest in the Townsville region in recent decades, particularly in regards to fire, is key to resolving the status of this and other locally threatened taxa that depend on this habitat.

Methods Fecal samples from 33 symptom-free NHP belonging to eight different species were collected weekly for 9 weeks. Species-level characterization and phylogenetic analysis of isolates included biochemical testing and 16S rRNA sequencing. Results Campylobacter spp. were isolated from the feces of 42% (14/33) of the primates. Three Campylobacter spp. (C upsaliensis, C jejuni, and novel Campylobacter sp.) were identified from three NHP species. A possible positive host Campylobacter species-specificity was observed. However, no statistical association was observed between the isolation of Campylobacter spp. and age and sex of the animal. Conclusions The study revealed the value of conducting repeated fecal sampling to establish the overall prevalence of Campylobacter in zoo-maintained NHP; it also importantly identifies a novel Campylobacter sp. isolated from white-faced saki monkeys.

Amphictene catharinensis (Grube, 1870) was described from material from off Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, but the most recent description for these animals comes from Nilsson (1928); a redescription for A. catharinensis is herein provided. Pectinaria nonatoi n. sp. was informally described as P. (Pectinaria) laelia nomen nudum in an unpublished thesis and a formal description has never been provided, although the species has been reported from several other localities off the Brazilian shoreline, mostly in ecological studies; the species is formally described herein and compared to the most similar congeners. Petta alissoni n. sp. is also described and compared to the most similar congeners and this is the first record for animals of this genus from southern Atlantic. There are also records for Pectinaria gouldii (Verrill, 1874) and P. regalis Verrill, 1901 from off the Brazilian coast, and a doubtful record for Lagis pseudokoreni (Day, 1955), but we did not find any material belonging to those taxa.

Sars in G.O. Sars, 1872), Pherusa plumosa (Muller, 1776), and Piromis eruca (Claparede, 1869). In this paper we report a fifth genus, Trophoniella, for the first time in Tunisia. The specimens were collected in Rades Station, Gulf of Tunis (Central Mediterranean) and belong to a new species, namely Trophoniella radesiensis n. sp., which is characterized by having: (1) a very smooth tunic, body covered dorsally, ventrally, and laterally by sediment grains (except in the posterior region), and (2) well-developed parapodia showing short neurohooks from chaetiger 6 to 19 and anchylosed neurohooks from chaetiger 20. Based on the 16S, the new species belongs to a low supported Piromis/Trophoniella clade and shows a 16.1% of genetic distance from Trophoniella hephaistos Jimi & Fujiwara, 2016, the single known species of the genus sequenced to date.

A second species of Araucariocladus Silveira & Mermudes, with notes on the variation in antennomere numbers in this genus (Coleoptera: Lampyridae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Amydetinae; Psilocladina; Allopatry; Mantiqueira	ATLANTIC RAIN-FOREST; FIREFLIES COLEOPTERA; EVOLUTION	Here, we describe Araucariocladus amfractus sp. nov., and compare it to the previously monotypic type-species, A. hiems. The new species can be distinguished from A. hiems by the following combination: colour pattern overall dark-brown; pedicel three times shorter than antennomere III and slightly wider than long; distance between antennal sockets as wide as 3/5 clypeal width; labial palpomere III with sides divergent towards apex, apical margin longer than dorsal and shorter than ventral margin; pronotum 1.5x wider than long, anterior margin somewhat sinuose, with a shallow angle anteriad, posterior margin almost straight. A. amfractus sp. nov. is, prima facie, endemic to the Itatiaia Massif, part of the Mantiqueira Mountain Range, Southeastern Brazil. We provide illustrations of the diagnostic features, and an occurrence map for the Araucariocladus species. Finally, we report a previously unrecognized intra-specific variation in the antennomere numbers of A. hiems, a feature also present in Araucariocladus amfractus sp. nov., and adjust the generic diagnosis to include species with 17 or 18 antennomeres.

Description and biology of two new egg parasitoid species (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) reared from eggs of Heliconiini butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae) in Panama	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Heliconius; hitch-hiking; ITS-2 region of ribosomal DNA; tropical lowland rainforest; Soberania National Park; Passiflora	NATURAL OCCURRENCE; WOLBACHIA; EVOLUTION; HABITAT; GENERA; PLANTS	Two new minute egg parasitoid wasp species belonging to the genus Trichogramma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), T. chagres sp. nov. and T. soberania sp. nov., were found in a tropical lowland rainforest in Panama, Central America. In this paper, we describe, illustrate and discuss the biology and morphological and molecular characterization of the two new Trichogramma wasp species. Both species were collected from eggs of passion vine butterflies, Agraulis vanillae vanillae (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae) and unidentified Heliconiini species, laid on different Passiflora species (Malpighiales: Passifloraceae). A female T. soberania sp. nov. wasp was observed on the wings of a female Heliconius hecale melicerta butterfly caught in the wild. This suggests that this species may occasionally be phoretic on adult female butterflies to find suitable host eggs. Our study adds two more species identifications to the scarce record of Trichogramma wasps from the widespread Heliconiini butterflies in Central America.

A review of the recently published book of Beinhundner (2017) has further revealed that one of the specimens mistakenly figured as Lophorrhina donckieri Bourgoin, 1913 in that work is most likely the female of this new species. Analysis of the diagnostic characters of the genus Lophorrhina Westwood, 1842 shows that the new species differs in several key areas. In particular, the clypeal armature is virtually identical in both sexes, the male protibiae are not typically elongate and narrow as in all the members of Lophorrhina, but are remarkably more robust, laterally expanded and with a tridentate margin in both sexes, even though the third tooth in the female and the second and third teeth in the male are virtually obsolete. The general body shape in the new species is also more globose and lacks the typical deplanate and apically tapering elytra of the Lophorrhina males. These and other characters are, in our view, sufficient to justify the erection of a new genus, Lophorrhinides gen. n., to accommodate the new species, here described as L. muellerae sp. n. The new genus is presumably a mountain specialist, as both known specimens were collected in the southern highlands of Tanzania, at Manow and Rungwe respectively.

Revision of the New World genera Adelius Haliday and Paradelius de Saeger (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Cheloninae: Adeliini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Adeliinae; Cheloninae; biodiversity; parasitoid; taxonomy; wasp	WASPS HYMENOPTERA	Species of adeliine braconids were previously described and named from all biogeographic areas of the world except the Neotropical Region. Here we present the first taxonomic revision of New World adeliines, as well as the first newly described species of both genera, Adelius and Paradelius, from the Neotropical Region. Although not commonly sampled because of their minute size and associations with leaf-mining hosts, our results indicate that adeliines actually have a wide distribution in the neotropics, especially in middle to high elevations and dry forests. In addition to redescriptions of all known Nearctic species, we present the first descriptions of the females of Adelius coloradensis and A. nigripectus, of 16 new species of the genus Adelius (A. adeleae Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. bolivariensis Bortoni & Penteado-Dias sp. n., A. boliviensis Bortoni & Penteado-Dias sp. n., A. caatinga Bortoni, Shimbori & Penteado-Dias sp. n., A. canadensis Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. ecuadoriensis Bortoni & Penteado-Dias sp. n., A. excelsus Bortoni & Shimbori sp. n., A. floridensis Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. gauldi Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. janzeni Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. monteiroi Souza-Gessner, Cerantola & Penteado-Dias sp. n., A. morretesiensis Bortoni, Shimbori & Penteado-Dias sp. n., A. panamensis Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. pentagonalis Shimbori & Shaw sp. n., A. quiteriae Souza-Gessner, Cerantola & Penteado-Dias sp. n., and A. sancticaroli Bortoni, Penteado-Dias & Shimbori sp. n.), and one new species of the genus Paradelius (P. neotropicalis Shimbori & Shaw sp. n.).

New and rich material from two localities in Poland and five localities in Lithuania contains Gothograptus nassa, Gothograptus obtectus and four new species. The detailed morphology and reconstruction of the tubarium shows its specific features, different from other lundgreni Biozone retiolitines. The tubarium is narrow, elongated, finite, massive and compact. The thecal orifices are hidden by simple hoods or by extraordinary reticulated veils, which may cover the ventral walls. The colonies of Gothograptus species from the lundgreni Biozone are short, usually having eight pairs of thecae, whereas species from the post-lundgreni interval may reach more than 20 pairs of thecae. A common feature of Gothograptus species is the presence of singular genicular structures tightly covering thecal orifices. Reticulated hoods and veils are characteristic of species from the lundgreni Biozone. The most common such structures are nassa hoods, located on the proximal thecae in some species from the lundgreni Biozone, and on every theca of post-lundgreni species. Only Gothograptus domeyki n. sp. has no genicular processes on most thecae. Within a total of four species from the lundgreni Biozone and three species from the nassa and praedeubeli Biozones, we describe here the new species Gothograptus domeyki and Gothograptus velo from the lundgreni Biozone, Gothograptus diminutus from the parvus/nassa Biozone, and Gothograptus auriculatus from the dubius/nassa and praedeubeli biozones; G auriculatus n. sp. is the youngest form of the genus Gothograptus. Variation within the genus Gothograptus during the post-lundgreni interval period is shown for the first time.

This species most resembles C. germanica Sumpich & Huemer, 2016, but differs in the colouration of the dorsum of the forewing and in the shape of the valva in the male genitalia. Differences in the DNA barcode region between these two species are rather low compared to differences between other species of the genus. Chrysoclista germanica, previously known only from the holotype, is recorded from the Czech Republic for the first time.

The new species Zicca gloriosa sp. nov. is described from the Dominican Republic. Another 12 species are new records for the island, 11 of them being new records for the Dominican Republic: Althos obscurator (Fabricius, 1803), Anasa acutangula Stal, 1870, Anasa tristis (De Geer, 1773), Eubule spartocerana Brailovsky, 1992, Leptoglossus confusus Alayo & Grillo, 1977, Mamurius cubanus Barber & Bruner, 1947, Merocoris distinctus Dallas, 1852, Merocoris typhaeus (Fabricius, 1798), Phthia rubropicta (Westwood, 1842), Sethenira ferruginea Stal, 1870, and Zicca rubricator rubricator (Fabricius, 1803). New records for Haiti are Anasa scorbutica (Fabricius, 1798), Catorhintha selector Stal, 1859, Chariesterus gracilicornis Stal, 1870, Rhytidophthia splendida (Valdes, 1910) and Zicca taeniola (Dallas, 1852). The literature citations presented in Perez-Gelabert (2008) of Leptoglossus cinctus (Herrich-Schaffer, 1836) and Leptoglossus stigma (Herbst, 1784) are probably based on erroneous identifications and not counted as part of the Hispaniolan fauna. The total number of species presently known from Hispaniola is raised to 28. Key to subfamilies, tribes, genera and species are included, as well as color dorsal habitus.

Two new species of the Simulium (Simulium) tuberosum species-group (Diptera: Simuliidae) from Palawan, the Philippines	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						biodiversity; taxonomy; biogeography; aquatic insects; fauna	ISLAND	Two new species of black flies, Simulium mainitense and S. tukurongense, are described from Palawan, the Philippines. Both species are placed in the Simulium nitidithorax subgroup of the Simulium tuberosum species-group of Simulium (Simulium). They are characterized by the female sensory vesicle of medium length, pupal thorax covered with round tubercles, and anterodorsal trichomes on the pupal thorax longer than frontal trichomes. This combination of characters separates these two new species from S. quasifrenum Delfinado, the only previously known member of the S. nitidithorax subgroup from Palawan, and nine other related species from Sabah, Sarawak, Peninsular Malaysia and India. Simulium mainitense sp. nov. is distinguished from S. tukurongense sp. nov. in the female by the somewhat larger body size, and greater length ratio of the labrum against the clypeus; and in the pupa by the much longer gill filaments.

(Hemiptera, Schizopteridae): amended diagnosis of the genus and first record from South America	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Distribution; minute litter bugs; Dipsocoromorpha; southern Brazil; Argentina	MINUTE LITTER BUGS	Hoplonannus McAtee & Maloch, 1925 comprises three species described from Central America. Females of all these species are known only from brachypterous specimens. This paper describes the first South American species of the genus, Hoplonannus australis sp. nov. The new species differs from its congeners, in females, by the submacroptery, presence of ocelli and a basal bulge in the seventh sternite; in males, it differs by the presence of a process in the eighth tergite and the right paramere bifurcate apically, with branches subparallel. These traits entail a new diagnosis for the genus.

Of them, five are described as new species: Trouessartia ampulicaudata sp. n. and T. petrochelidon sp. n. from the American cliff swallow Petrochelidon pyrrhonota (Vieillot), T. bochkovi sp. n. from the tree swallow Tachycineta bicolor (Vieillot), and T. cryptocaudata sp. n. and T. progne sp. n. from the purple martin Progne subis (Linnaeus). A new species group stelgidopteryx, incorporating Trouessartia species living on hirundinids of the genera Progne, Tachycineta and Stelgidopteryx, is established. Renewed diagnoses of four Trouessartia species groups (appendiculata, crucifera, minutipes, and stelgidopteryx) restricted to hirundinids and a key to species recorded so far and potentially expected on swallows of North America are proposed. Host associations of Trouessartia species with swallows in North America are briefly discussed.

Based on specimens collected in the Congolese region of the Katanga and the northeast of Angola during the first decades of the twentieth century, de Witte and Laurent independently suggested, based on morphological and coloration differences, that populations of T. megalura of these regions could belong a new "race". We compared specimens of T. megalura (including the type specimens of T. megalura and T. massaiana) with Angolan and Katangan museum specimens as well as newly collected specimens from Angola. Coloration pattern and morphological characters, in combination with substantial divergence in the 16S mitochondrial gene, confirm the distinctiveness of the west Central African form, and it is here described as a new species. Data regarding its natural history, ecology and global distribution are presented.

Closely related to the genus Cleonardo, this new genus can be distinguished from most other known eusirid genera by the presence of a telson distally cleft and distinctly bilobate, of a distal spiniform process on uropod 1 peduncle and of a simple, stout and medium length dactylus on pereopods 5-7. The combination of all these characters can be considered relevant for the affiliation of this species to a new genus within Eusiridae. Due to its very close morphological affinity to Dorotea gen. nov., the bathyal sub-Antarctic species Eusiroides aberrantis Bellan-Santini & Ledoyer, 1987 cannot be maintained in the family Pontogeneiidae and it should be transferred to the family Eusiridae.

These species belong to two genera of marine triclads, previously unrecorded from China, viz. Nerpa Marcus, 1948 and Paucumara Sluys, 1989. Nerpa fistulata Wang & Chen, sp. nov. is characterized by: transparent body; principally pentamerous intestine with three distinct commissures; two very large, prepharyngeal testis follicles; a semi-circular lens in each eye cup; a penis papilla provided with a chitinized, pointed stylet; lateral bursae communicating with the oviduct and opening ventrally to the exterior via a duct. Phylogenetically N. fistulata groups with one member of the family Bdellouridae. This new, Chinese species of Nerpa introduces a major geographic disjunction, as the type species N. evelinae was described from the bay of Santos, Brazil, so that the genus is now known from both Atlantic as well as Pacific coasts. The species Paucumara falcata Wang & Li, sp. nov. is characterized by: three distinct pale yellow transverse pigmentation bands on its dorsal side, between which some snowflake-like specks are randomly distributed, and a brown transverse band anteriorly to the eyes; 8-11 testicular follicles on either side of the body, the follicles extending from immediately behind the ovaries to half-way along the pharyngeal pocket; a musculo-parenchymatic organ with a sclerotic, curved tip projecting from the anterior wall of the male atrium, ventrally to the root of the penis papilla. Phylogenetically P. falcata groups with its congener P. trigonocephala, with the genus Paucumara forming the sister taxon of the genus Ectoplana. Comparison of the nerve structure of P. falcata, as revealed by AChE histochemistry, with that of eight other species of triclad suggested that the nervous system of marine planarians is simpler than that of species of freshwater planarians, but revealed also that the nerve structure is rather variable among species. The copulatory position exhibited by two partners in Paucumara falcata is remarkable in that they intertwine, with their heads pointing downwards and the tails pointing upwards, the entire process lasting about 10 min. Such a copulatory position has never before been reported for triclad flatworms.

Prior to this, 12 Strumigenys species had been recorded from Hong Kong, all confirmed here. Moreover, we add to this list three newly described species: S. hirsuta sp. n., S. lantaui sp. n., and S. nathistorisoc sp. n., and describe for the first time the worker caste of S. formosa Terayama, Lin & Wu, 1995. We report new records for nine additional species, bringing the total number of species to 24, including four newly recorded species (S. hexamera Brown, 1958, S. membranifera Emery, 1869, S. nepalensis Baroni Urbani and De Andrade, 1994, and S. rogeri Emery, 1890) which are considered to be introduced to Hong Kong. A global review of the introduced Strumigenys species is presented. The taxonomic validity of S. feae and S. formosensis is discussed in light of new specimen measurements. New ecological information on the swarming periods of 11 species is presented on the basis of year-long sampling of aerial insects. Finally, the importance of our results within Southeast Asia and the need for future sampling efforts in the region is discussed.

It is known that these species are broadly distributed, parasitizing various aphid hosts and showing great biological and ecological diversity. On the other hand, this group of endoparasitoids is understudied and was thought to be represented by a single species in Europe, viz., Paralipsis enervis (Nees). However, recent description of two new species indicated the possibility of cryptic speciation and recognition of additional Paralipsis species in Europe. In this research, Paralipsis specimens collected during the last 60 years from eight European countries, as well as one sample from Morocco, were subjected to molecular and morphological characterization. Newly designed genus-specific degenerative primers successfully targeted short overlapping fragments of COI of the mitochondrial DNA. Molecular analyses showed clear separation of four independent lineages, two of which are the known species P. enervis and P. tibiator, while two new species are described here, viz., P. brachycaudi Tomanovic & Stary, sp. n. and P. rugosa Tomanovic & Stary, sp. n. No clear specialization of the taxa to a strict root aphid host has been determined. The recognized mitochondrial lineages were distinct one from another, but with a substantial within-lineage divergence rate, clearly indicating the complexity of this group of parasitoids, on which further research is required in order to clarify the factors triggering their genetic differentiation.

Review of the fossil record of Bolitophilidae, with description of new taxa and discussion of position of Mangas Kovalev (Diptera: Sciaroidea)	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						Bolitophilidae; Bolitophila; Mangas; Kishenehn Formation; Baltic amber; Khasurty; Cretaceous; Eocene; fossil insect; new species	PHYLOGENY	The dipteran family Bolitophilidae, with the single extant genus Bolitophila, is a small family of mycophagous flies. In marked contrast to related families such as Sciaridae and Mycetophilidae, the family has a poor fossil record with no definite species assigned to the genus. In addition, the position of the extinct Cretaceous subfamily Mangasinae Kovalev, 1986 (described in Bolitophillidae) has been controversial and it has been suggested that species in this clade may belong to other sciaroid families. This situation is made worse by misplacement of the type specimen. We herein describe two new species of Bolitophila, Bolitophila warreni sp. nov. from the 46-million-year-old Kishenehn Formation in Montana, USA and Bolitophila rohdendorfi sp. nov. from Baltic amber. Bolitophila pulveris Lewis, 1969 is reassigned to Sciaroidea incertae sedis. The subfamily Mangasinae is reviewed and its position within the Bolitophilidae confirmed. Two new species of Mangas, M. kovalevi sp. nov. and M. brevisubcosta sp. nov., both from the Lower Cretaceous of Khasurty in Western Transbaikalia, are described.

ZOOTAXA			English	Article						New species; eastern Bering Sea; Alaska; Porifera; Demospongiae; Poecilosclerida; Microcionidae	BOTTOM TRAWL SURVEY; GROUNDFISH	A total of 493 sponges were collected with a bottom trawl during annual groundfish stock assessment surveys in the eastern Bering Sea in 2013, 2015, and 2016 to build an inventory of species in this largely unexplored region. We report here principally on the demosponge fauna collected during those surveys because identifications of hexactinellids are incomplete. We identified 42 unique demosponge taxa from the collection including geographical range extensions for 30 species; seven are new records for the Pacific Ocean. The collection also included three species new to science; two have been previously described (Plicatellopsis borealis Lehnert & Stone 2017, Spongosorites beringensis Lehnert & Stone 2017) and Antho ridgwayi sp. nov. described here. The new species differed from all northern hemisphere congeners in the complements and sizes of spicules. We document that the region is more species rich than previously suspected, particularly the continental slope where the majority of hexactinellid sponges are located.

Its fungus-like body form with long peduncle and absence of hypodermalia suggest placement within the euplectellid subfamily Bolosominae Tabachnick, 2002, whereas molecular phylogenetic evidence suggests that it is sister to all remaining Euplectellidae Gray, 1867. Its rhizophytous method of attachment to the substrate, hitherto unknown from bolosomine Euplectellidae, a veil of pentactins covering the peduncle, and the presence of toothed discohexasters as the only type of microscleres, clearly characterize it as a new genus. The intraspecific divergence between holotype and paratypes of the new species is examined with both morphological and molecular approaches. This report represents the first record of a hexactinellid sponge from the Yap Trench.

Major diagnostic features are illustrated based on both male and female specimens. The new species shows some adaptations to cave life, such as pale brown colour, setation consisting of long and flattened setae and suberect shorter setae, absence of wings, anophthalmy, and elongated legs and antennae.

Molecular study supports the position of the New Zealand endemic genus Lamellomorpha in the family Vulcanellidae (Porifera, Demospongiae, Tetractinellida), with the description of three new species	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						New species; Poecillastra; Porifera; secondary loss; Subantarctic New Zealand	SPONGE	Due to the possession of huge contort strongyles, and a lack of triaenes in an otherwise 'astrophorine' spicule complement, the phylogenetic position of the endemic, monospecific New Zealand sponge genus, Lamellomorpha Bergquist, 1968, has remained enigmatic. The genus was established within Jaspidae de Laubenfels, 1968 (in the abandoned order Epipolasida Sollas, 1888), but it was not until 2002 that the genus was transferred formally to Astrophorina Sollas, 1887, albeit incertae sedis, by Hooper & Maldonado (2002). In this study, we recognise specimens of Lamellomorpha from the Subantarctic New Zealand region and Chatham Rise, considered by Bergquist to be conspecific with the type species, L. strongylata Bergquist, 1968, first described from the Three Kings-Spirits Bay region of Northland, as the new species, L. australis Kelly & Cardenas sp. nov. These two species of Lamellomorpha have differences in external morphology and colour, skeletal architecture and spicules, natural products, geographical distribution, and depth ranges. Sequencing of the COI Folmer barcode/mini-barcode and of 28S (C1-C2 domains) of these two species suggests phylogenetic affinities of Lamellomorpha with the tetractinellid suborder Astrophorina and the family Vulcanellidae Cardenas et al., 2011. Two Subantarctic New Zealand species of the vulcanellid genus Poecillastra Sollas, 1888, P. ducitriaena Kelly & Cardenas sp. nov. and P. macquariensis Kelly & Cardenas sp. nov., provide further support for the close relationship of Lamellomorpha and Poecillastra.

The new species has a female body length of 6.8-9.1 mm; a comparatively long odontostyle (114.0-127.5 mu m); a narrow lip region (14.0-15.5 mu m), anteriorly flattened and almost continuous with the body profile; pocket-like amphidial pouches long, deeply bilobed, and slightly asymmetrical, a guide ring at 37-42 mu m from the anterior end; normal arrangement of pharyngeal glands; and a short bluntly rounded to hemispherical tail. Four juvenile stages identified: the first stage with a digitate tail, and the second and subsequent stages with a bluntly rounded tail. Males have one adcloacal pair and a row of 10 or 11 single ventromedian supplements; spicules 71.0-74.5 mu m long. Based on morphometric data, the new species belongs to a group of species spread over Europe (L. arthensis, L. silvae, L. uroshis,), Iran (L. kheirii), and Syria (L. pauli), which share common characters such as amphidial fovea, lip region and tail shapes, similar odontostyle and body length, and similar first-stage juvenile tail shape. Codes for identifying the new species are A5, B2, C34, D3, E3, F45, G12, H1, I2, J1, K7. The phylogenetic analysis based on D2-D3 expansion domains of the rRNA gene revealed that the new species has the closest relationships with L. athesinus from Italy and three unidentified Longidorus spp. from USA (Longidorus sp. 1, Longidorus sp. 2, and Longidorus sp. 6). New morphometric and molecular data (18S rRNA gene, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions and D2-D3 28S rRNA gene sequences) for three populations of L. pisi from Bulgaria were obtained and variations between populations are discussed.

Phreatomascogos gregoi gen. n. et sp. n. from Don Martin Basin, Coahuila, is described based on shells and opercula that show some morphological similarities with shells of Phreatodrobia Hershler & Longley, 1986 (Lithoglyphidae), which is a subterranean genus from neighboring area in Texas, United States. Conchologically, the new genus can be distinguished from Phreatoelrobia and all other subterranean genera by a unique combination of characteristic shell morphology and opercula apomorphies. Balconorbis sabinasense sp. n. (Cochliopidae) is the second species of this genus, which was previously known only from caves and associated subterranean habitats in Texas. The new record of Coahuiliv parrasense, Czaja, Estrada-Rodriguez, Romero-Mendez, Avila-Rodriguez, Meza-Sinchez & Covich, 2017 (Cochliopidae) from Durango and Coahuila is the first record of extant member of this genus out of its hitherto known habitat in the Cuatro Cienegas basin, Coahuila. These records are remarkable because C. parrasense had been described recently as a fossil species. Shell morphologies of the new subterranean snails could be interpreted as possible evolutional adaptations to different hydrodynamic and other specific conditions in their habitat.

We also report the occurrence of L. parkeri in Ecuador, on paramos of Yacuri National Park, near the border with Peru. We used morphological and genetic evidence for the description of the new species and the new report of L. parkeri. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference on DNA sequences for mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The phylogeny shows that L. simmonsi is sister to a clade composed of the remaining species of Lynchius and that the new species is sister to L. flavomaculatus. The new species has a prominent and heavily ossified head with noticeably spiculate cranial exostosis that easily distinguishes it from all its congeners. The dorsal region and limbs present several reduced subconical and rounded tubercles and pronounced dermal ridges on the dorsum. We also describe the osteology of the new species based on x-rays of the holotype. Only six species of Lynchius, two known to occur in Ecuador (L. flavomaculatus and L. simmonsi). The description of L. megacephalus sp. n. and new record of L. parkeri double the number of known Lynchius in Ecuador and suggest that the diversity of Ecuadorian and Peruvian Lynchius is still underestimated.

DNA sequence analyses identified deep divisions between Queensland and New South Wales populations, and among populations in each state. Detailed morphological and morphometric evaluation of the specimens failed, in most cases, to identify unambiguous morphological characters of diagnostic value for each population, possibly due to the interaction of morphological conservatism with high levels of variability resulting from their continued moulting after reaching sexual maturity. Several strong consistent characters were identified to support the description of a southern Queensland population as a new species (Heterolepisma cooloola sp. nov.). The combined molecular and morphological data support the view that the presence of lanceolate scales and the absence of macrochaetae from the anterior margin of the frons are more significant to phylogeny than the arrangement of styli and the shape of the thoracic sternites in Heterolepisma. Specimens from Glen Davis, NSW, while indistinguishable from H. sclerophylla in all other characters examined, were found to possess one fewer pair of abdominal styli in both sexes and are also described as a new species (Heterolepisma coorongooba sp. nov.). Five lineages are recognized within the remaining NSW material but as reliable (non-overlapping) morphological and morphometric differences could not be identified, they are not described here as new species. Heterolepisma sclerophylla sensu stricto is considered to be a complex of morphologically ill-defined species or perhaps subspecies.	[Smith, Graeme B.; Mitchell, Andrew; Lee, Timothy R.

Two additional species were later named, C. castanotis and C. occidentalis, which have since been synonymised with C. ecaudatus. Taxonomic research on the genus is rather difficult because of the limited material available for study. Aside from the types of C. castanotis and C. occidentalis housed at the Natural History Museum in London, and the type of C. ecaudatus at the Australian Museum in Sydney, there are fewer than 30 other modern specimens in other collections scattered around the world. Examining skeletal and dental characters for several specimens, and using a combination of traditional morphology, morphometrics, palaeontology and molecular phylogenetics, we have identified two distinct species, C. ecaudatus and C. yirratji sp. nov., with C. ecaudatus having two distinct subspecies, C. e. ecaudatus and C. e. occidentalis. We use palaeontological data to reconstruct the pre-European distribution of the two species, and review the ecological information known about these extinct taxa.

Mature myxospores of C. ghannouchensis were stubby with a convex anterior end and almost straight to slightly concave posterior one. Mature myxospores measured 5.8 +/- 0.4 (5-7) mu m in length and 11.7 +/- 0.3 (11-13) mu m in thickness. Valves were unequal in size with one occasionally tapering to a greater degree than the other. The polar capsules were equal in size, spherical in shape and measured 2 +/- 0.2 (1.8-2.8) mu m in diameter. Infection with C. pallida occurs as spherical to elongated mono-, di- or trisporic plasmodia floating in the bile. Mature myxospores were crescent-shaped with two symmetrical shell valves with rounded edges. The myxospores measured 6 +/- 0.5 (5-7) mu m in length and 28.5 +/- 2.5 (26-33) mu m in thickness. The polar capsules were spherical, equal in size and measured 3 +/- 0.3 (2.7-3.3) mu m in diameter. Based on the SSU rDNA partial sequence, C. ghannouchensis n. sp. and C. pallida appeared in the same subclade with Ceratomyxa leatherjacketi and Ceratomyxa tunisiensis.

Gekko flavimaritus sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of morphological characters: medium size for Gekko (snout-vent length 76.0-84.5 mm in six adult males, 67.5-78.3 mm in 11 adult females); nares in contact with rostral; two enlarged postmentals; 12-16 dorsal tubercle rows; 27-35 ventral scale rows; 10-15 subdigital lamellae on first toe, 15-18 on fourth toe; finger and toe webbing weakly developed; tubercle absent on dorsal surface of forelimbs and hindlimbs; adult male with 7-8 precloacal pores, in continuous row; precloacal pores absent in females; single postcloacal tubercle on each side; tubercles present on dorsal surface of tail base; subcaudals enlarged; sexual dimorphism present (colouration on dorsum in life - yellow in adult males and brownish grey in adult females); dorsum with whitish vertebral blotches between nape and base of tail. Genetically, the new species is nested within the G. petricolus group and is closely related to G. boehmei and G. petricolus. The new species has uncorrected pairwise divergences of >= 18.57% of the ND2 gene from other species of G. petricolus group. Additionally, we present the first genetic data for G. lauhachindai, and verify its morphological assignment to the G. petricolus group.

The new species closely resembles Sardinella fimbriata (Valenciennes, 1847), both species having lateral scales with centrally discontinuous striae, a dark spot on the dorsal-fin origin, more than 70 lower gill rakers on the first gill arch, the pelvic fin with eight rays, and 17 or 18 prepelvic and 12 or 13 postpelvic scutes. However, the new species is distinguished from the latter by lower counts of lateral scales, pseudobranchial filaments, and postpelvic scutes (38-41, 14-19 and 12-13, respectively vs. 44-46, 19-22 and 13-14), and a shorter lower jaw (10.4-11.6% of standard length vs. 11.1-12.2%). Sardinella pacifica sp. n. is known only from the Philippines, whereas S. fimbriata is restricted to the Indian Ocean, although previously considered to be an Indo-West Pacific species, distributed from India to the Philippines.

GEN.; CRUSTACEA; EUMALACOSTRACA; SP.	Indobathynella socrates n. sp. is described from Karaiguda Cave in the Visakhapatnam District of Andhra Pradesh state, south-eastern India. This is the first cavernicolous species of Indobathynella, which is incidentally the most reduced genus in the family Bathynellidae as a whole. The type species of this genus, Indobathynella prehensilis, is from a farm bore. The new species fulfils all the principal generic criteria of Indobathynella, but is distinctly different from I. prehensilis in several essential features: absence of subapical seta on antennary exopod; 4 claws on distal maxillulary endite; 6 teeth on mandibular gnathobase, and uropodal exopod without ventro-medial seta. These and all other salient differences between the two species are tabulated. Besides providing brief notes on conservation and biogeography of the new species, a key to all the known Indian taxa of Bathynellidae is given for the first time.

J	Dittmann, IL; Dibiasi, W; Norena, C; Egger, B				Dittmann, Isabel L.; Dibiasi, Wolfgang; Norena, Carolina; Egger, Bernhard			Description of the snail-eating flatworm in marine aquaria, Pericelis tectivorum sp. nov. (Polycladida, Platyhelminthes)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Leopardenstrudelwurm (German); aquarium predator; integrative taxonomy; Cotylea; morphology		We describe a new marine snail-eating flatworm, Pericelis tectivorum sp. nov., found in coral-bearing marine aquaria. Pericelis tectivorum sp. nov. is characterised by several differential characters of the external and internal morphology like 1) a long line of frontal eyes extending anteriorly; 2) the length of the penis papilla; 3) the spherical seminal vesicle; 4) the lack of the enlargements of the ejaculatory duct; 5) the uterine vesicles, which start posterior of the female genital at the level of the sucker and 6) the distinct sucker. The combination of these characters in one species is unique and therefore the studied specimens are recognised by us as a new species. We additionally present a phylogenetic reconstruction using partial 28S rDNA sequences including three congeners. Our analysis demonstrates that P. tectivorum sp. nov. differs also genetically from other Pericelis species included in this analysis.

Coronostrongylus hasegawai n. sp. is most similar to C. spearei, the only other species described from New Guinea, in having 24 longitudinal pleats in the buccal cavity and spicules less than 1,400 long. Coronostrongylus hasegawai differs from C. spearei, in a suite of characters including the shape of the cephalic collar, the proportions of the buccal capsule, the disposition of the bursal rays, the length of the spicules and the proportions of the ovejector. Dorcopsistrongylus supriyatnai n. sp differs from all congeners in lacking large anteriorly directed intestinal diverticula. The genus Coronostrongylus is found in Australia and New Guinea while the genus Dorcopsistrongylus appears to be endemic to New Guinea.

It was also observed underwater at the southern tip of Ras Mohammed and Marsa Alam in Egypt. Cerogobius petrophilus sp. nov. is unique among other gobies in its habitat, and in this regard it superficially resembles some species of blennies, occupying tight holes in stones covered with short algae. Molecular phylogenetic data suggest a close relationship between Cerogobius petrophilus sp. nov. and Hetereleotris, but the former differs from the latter morphologically in head shape with specific proportions of orbit and snout, forward-set position of eyes, a moderately large mouth, a long horn-like tentacle at the nostrils in the middle of snout, caudal peduncle deep and short, and in details of cephalic sensory system. A full description of the new genus and species is provided and is accompanied with osteological data that potentially can be informative in further comparisons with Hetereleotris.

Description of a new diminutive, rupicolous species of day-gecko (Squamata: Gekkonidae: Cnemaspis) from southern Sri Lanka	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Cnemaspis kumarasinghei; dry zone; forest; gekkonid; lizard	SAURIA GEKKONIDAE; SP NOV.; REPTILIA; PHYLOGENY	A new species of Cnemaspis is described from southern Sri Lanka. Cnemaspis ingerorum sp. nov. was previously confused with C. kumarasinghei. The new species differs from C. kumarasinghei in having a lower number of ventral scales across midbody, scales on ventral sides of forelimb and hind-limb smooth (versus keeled) and dorsal caudal scales unkeeled (versus keeled). Additionally, Cnemaspis ingerorum sp. nov. has a 4.5% uncorrected ND2 sequence divergence from C. kumarasinghei and is also geographically separated from this species. Existing molecular data supports C. silvula as the sister species of the new form, however, it differs from C. silvula by the absence of keeled pectoral and abdominal scales and dorsal scales, and the absence of keeled (versus keeled) subcaudal scales.

(Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is described from Eocene Baltic amber and assigned to Gonialaenini trib. nov. within the subfamily Lagriinae due to the combination of the following characters: labrum elongate; antennal sensilla simple; procoxal cavities closed at least externally; narrow membranes present between abdominal ventrites 3-5; mesocoxal cavities partly closed by mesepimeron, trochantine present; ovipositor of primitive lagrioid type-digitate fourth coxite lobe with gonostyles apically. Gonialaena gen. nov. combines characters of various Lagriinae tribes: humeral angles rounded, formed by basally widened epipleura as in Goniaderini, Pycnocerini and Lupropini; narrow acute intercoxal process of abdominal ventrite 1 as in Belopini, Cossyphini and Lagriini; absence (or strong reduction) of metathoracic wings as in most Adeliini and some Lupropini; large, reniform eyes as in Goniaderini, Pycnocerini, Lagriini and many Adeliini; present intersegmental membranes between abdominal ventrites 3-5 as in all lagriine tribes except for Belopini and Cossyphini; subcylindrical terminal maxillary palpomere as in Belopini and Cossyphini. Thus, the position of Gonialaenini trib. nov. within Lagriinae is not fully understood, but combination of certain features (humeral angles rounded but distinct and vertical border present at elytral base, inconspicuous elytral striae, large reniform eyes, narrow intersegmental membranes) points on morphological similarity with Goniaderini, especially some Anaedus Blanchard, 1845 with indistinct elytral striae and related genera.

(Diptera, Chironomidae) is described from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (similar to 100 Ma). The adult male of the new species shows the wing venation pattern lacking a crossvein MCu, the fore leg ratio lower than 1, and the gonostylus folded inwards - features typical of the subfamily Orthocladiinae. A bifid gonostylus, with an articulate, likely movable inner branch, is the character indicating a close relationship between Myanmaro and Diplocladius Kieffer, 1908, the latter genus previously postulated as an early lineage in Orthocladiinae. Several characters, i.e. the structure of tergite IX and the anal point, are defined as generic autapom orphies for Myanmaro. A combination of the shape of hypopygial volsellae (or their absence) and the lack of tibial combs also separate this genus from related extant Orthocladiinae and from the only known Cretaceous extinct orthoclad genus Lebanorthocladius Veltz, Azar et Nel, 2007.

The monotypic new genus superficially resembles the udeocorine genus Laryngodus Herrich-Schaeffer in general facies, and is sympatric with one of the species of Laryngodus. Pseudolaryngodus has some characters that share its tribal placement within both Udeocorini and Myodochini of the family Rhyparochromidae. However, it lacks inner laterotergites on abdomen, making it a Myodochini rather than a Udeocorini. Details of the relationships between these two genera, along with their tribal placements, are discussed.	[Malipatil, M.

(Orthoptera: Acrididae: Oedipodinae) is described based on specimens collected from Xinjiang, northern China. The new species is similar to H. brevipennis Zheng & Lu, 2002 and H. turanica Uvarov, 1925, but differs from: (1) dark brown in general coloration, (2) darker coloration in forewings, (3) forewings longer than H. brevipennis but shorter than H. turanica, (4) cubital area of forewings boarder than H. brevipennis and H. turanica, (5) hind tibiae dark brown with two light yellow pre-basal rings, while dark with one fade pre-basal ring in H. brevipennis and light yellow with three dark rings in H. turanica. In addition, the complete mitogenome of holotype was sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. The total length of the assembled mitogenome is 16,145 bp, representing 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and one noncoding region (D-loop region). The new mitogenome sequence is compared with published Oedipodinae mitogenomes and the phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily are reconstructed. The results infer that the gene cox/ could be a useful marker for higher phylogenetic level, while the genes nd5 and rrnL could be potentially useful markers between closely related species.

Taxonomic notes on Trigonidium and related groups with one new species from the Philippines (Orthoptera: Trigonidiidae; Trigonidiinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						COI; gene tree; Old World; sword-tailed cricket; systematics; taxonomy	GRYLLIDAE	The taxonomy of Old World Trigonidiinae (sword-tailed crickets) is in need of major revision. This includes its type genus Trigonidium. Various authors have different opinions on what constitutes the subgenera and species of Trigonidium s. 1. and this has led to considerable confusion and inconsistencies. Recent use of molecular data has helped make some progress in resolving some of these problems, but there are still limitations. In this paper, we aim to provide a baseline to resolve the confusion in the taxonomy of Trigonidium s. 1. Firstly, we provide a literature review of the contentious taxa related to Trigonidium and also provide some recommendations on future work for Trigonidium s. 1. Secondly, we reanalysed the gene tree (sensu Lu et al., 2018) using more DNA sequences from GenBank to test whether Trigonidium s. str. and Paratrigonidium should be considered separate genera or subgenera of Trigonidium s. 1. However, the gene tree based on current data was not conclusive. Lastly, we describe a new species of Trigonidium s. str. from Siargao Island, Mindanao (Philippines): Trigonidium solis sp. nov.

Brookesia tedi sp. n. occurs above 1300 m above sea level on the Marojejy massif in northeastern Madagascar. It is genetically sister to B. peyrierasi, a species occurring in lowlands around the Baie de Antongil, but is genetically strongly divergent from that species in both nuclear (c-mos) and mitochondrial (16S, ND2) genes, and morphologically in its smaller size and distinctly different hemipenis. It is the second species of the B. minima species group from Marojejy National Park, but is not known to occur in syntopy with the other species, B. karchei, due to elevational segregation.

Two taxa, each represented by a single female and referred to as genus X1 (Sulawesi) and X2 (Philippines), were included in that study. Recently, a new sample of scydmaenines from Luzon has become available to my study, including a series of male and female specimens of the genus X2.

Fish Otoliths from the Cabarruyan Piacenzian-Gelasian fauna found in the Philippines	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Osteichthyes; fossil; taxonomy; Indo-West Pacific; new species; deepwater	PLIOPLEISTOCENE; GASTROPODA; VETIGASTROPODA; PLEISTOCENE; REVISION	We studied fish otoliths from twelve sediment samples of a well-preserved late Pliocene to early Pleistocene fauna originally from the northwest Philippines that were originally deposited in relatively deepwater marine environment. The fish fauna is systematically described, its paleoenvironmental character is explored, and its diversity is analyzed. Four unknown species have been encountered: Parascombrops schwarzhansi n. sp., Maurolicus sp., Pteropsaron sp., and Priolepis sp., of which one is described as new species and three were left in open nomenclature as their local recent counterparts are not well known yet. In addition, a variant Benthosema, Benthosema aff fibulatum, is described. Overall, fifty-three taxa of fish otoliths were found, of which eighteen were identified at the species level and an additional twenty-seven at the genus level. Most extant species nowadays occur around the Philippines in relatively deep water (about 200 m depth), which is congruent with earlier studies on mollusks and echinoderms from the same deposits. This is the first study on a fossil fish otolith assemblage from the Philippines. Its diversity is very high and analysis by rarefaction curves suggests that additional sampling would add more fish species to the presented fauna list.	[van Hinsbergh, Victor W.

The new species is characterized by having short body length (430-635 mu m), lateral fields composed of four incisures, with non areolated bands, cephalic region smooth and continuous with body contour, stylet 9-12.5 mu m long, basal bulb short and pyriform to slightly cylindrical, V = 63.3 (58-65.5), spermatheca non-offset, tail elongate-conoid, tail tip with various shapes and males with 16.5 (15-18) mu m long spicules. Morphologically, the new species is similar to five known species of the genus: B. babhi, B. brevia, B. graminophila, B. lauta and B. shahidi. Morphological comparisons with these species are discussed. The sequence of the D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rDNA gene for the new species was also used for molecular phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic relationships of the new species in relation to representatives of the family Tylenchidae, obtained from Bayesian inference (BI) analysis of the D2-D3 sequences, are presented and discussed. The new species clusters in a subclade containing three unidentified species of the genus Basiria from Iran with high support.

An emended diagnosis of the genus Dendrorchis includes the characteristics of the new species. This is the first record of an adult digenean in an annual killifish from South America.	[Monteiro, C.

The male of Trichoncus hirtus Denis, 1965 is described for the first time. Three new combinations are proposed: Improphantes huberti (Wunderlich, 1980) comb. nov. and Palliduphantes corsicos (Wunderlich, 1980) comb. nov., both ex Lepthyphantes Menge, 1866; P. gladiola (Simon, 1884) comb. nov. ex Mansuphantes Saaristo & Tanasevitch, 1996. Agyneta mollis (O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1871), Entelecara acuminata (Wider, 1834), Minicia marginella (Wider, 1834) and Trichoncus hackmani Millidge, 1955 are reported as new for the Corsican fauna; Agyneta mesasiatica Tanasevitch, 2000 is new for the Corsican and for the French fauna. In addition, a new locality of A. mesasiatica from Italy (Toscana) is given. The type of distribution is given for each species. The linyphiid fauna of Corsica is rich, containing at least 94 species, and can be characterized as Mediterranean, with a high proportion of presumed endemics (14%).

Three species are described as new: R. brevis sp. nov. (male and female), R. laxa sp. nov. (female) and R. sumatera sp. nov. (male and female). The unknown female of R. grata Millidge, 1995 is described for the first time. The structure of the male palp of R. grata (the type species) is re-examined and illustrated. The taxonomic position of the genus among the linyphiid subfamilies is discussed.

The specimens of the new species were caught during the AtlantNIRO research expedition (1981) at the depths of 950-1000 m. The new species differs from other species of the Melanostigma genus by unique biological amplification of the lateral line of the body, which has four series of neuromasts (predorsal, dorsolateral, mediolateral, and ventral), and original combination of the features in the structure of the head canals of the lateral line, the axial skeleton, and coloration. The phenomenon of the lateral line polymerization, which is observed in a number of groups of higher Teleostei, including the Zoarcidae family, is considered in detail.	[Balushkin, A.

J	Negrete, L; Gira, RD; Brusa, F				Negrete, Lisandro; Diaz Gira, Rafael; Brusa, Francisco			Two new species of land planarians (Platyhelminthes, Tricladida, Geoplanidae) from protected areas in the southern extreme of the Paranaense Rainforest, Argentina	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Land flatworms; Geoplaninae; Obama; Notogynaphallia; Riverine forests; Rio de la Plata Basin	DIVERSITY	Here, we describe two new flatworm species of the genera Obama Carbayo et al., 2013 and Notogynaphallia Ogren & Kawakatsu, 1990 (Geoplaninae) found in riverine forests of central-eastern Argentina. Obama maculatentis sp. nov., which is about 50 mm in length, is characterized by black olive pigmentation on the dorsum, with two irregular rows of black spots, and light grey ventral surface. The eyes, with clear halos, extend to the dorsal surface. The foremost features of the copulatory apparatus include dorsal testes anterior to ovaries, extrabulbar prostatic vesicle with forked proximal portion, protrusible penis, male atrium with a large dorsal fold separating it from the female atrium, ovovitelline ducts ascending at the level of the gonopore, common ovovitelline duct dorsal to the distal portion of the female atrium, female canal ventro-anteriorly flexed, and female atrium with narrow lumen. Notogynaphallia fortuita sp. nov., which is about 30 mm in length, is characterized by beige ground pigmentation with tiny darker spots, cephalic region saffron yellow, and ventral surface light grey. The eyes, with small clear halos, extend to the dorsal surface. Regarding the internal anatomy, this new species shows parenchymatic musculature not organized in discrete layers, testes arising near the anterior end of the body, distal sperm ducts traversing the common muscle coat and joining in a short common sperm duct. The areas in which the land planarians were found represent the southernmost latitudes with representatives of the Interior Atlantic Forest (Paranaense Rainforest) biota, hence their biogeographical and conservation significance.

These populations may have split similar to 15Ma from the Dinarides and evolved in isolation due to the tectonic north-eastern movement of the Tisza-Dacia mega-unit (including the Apuseni Mountains) through the Pannonian Basin during the Miocene. Molecular and morphological evidence supports that these populations are a new species of crayfish, Austropotamobius bihariensis n. sp, named for the region of Biharia. The bPTP approach supported a new species clade by 0.89 Bayesian Support Value, diverging from the sister clade of Austropotamobius torrentium (haplogroup ZV) by 43 mutational steps in 582 base length nucleotides of COI mtDNA sequences. The differentiating morphological features are the lack of denticulation on the lower edge of the antennal scale, a significantly shorter bell-shaped rostrum, and fewer tubercles on the chelae palms than its relative. Its distribution is geographically restricted to upper sectors of the Cri. rivers basins, western Apuseni Mountains, Romania and it prefers cleaner waters than A. torrentium. Conservation measures are highly recommended. (c) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Morphologically, the new species is most similar to Parasesarma samawati, Parasesarma longicristatum and Parasesarma semperi with 7 or 8 rounded, well developed chelar dactylus tubercles, and appears to have been previously misidentified as P. longicristatum with which it occurs sympatrically. It differs, however, from P. longicristatum and P. semperi by having relatively shorter cheliped fingers as well as more distinct dorsal carapace regions and frontal lobes. Genetically, P. austrawati n. sp. is sister to a clade containing Parasesarma lividum from the southwest Pacific and P. samawati from East Africa. P. austrawati n. sp. is the seventh species of Parasesarma reported from northern Australian mangroves west of Torres Strait. (c) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

However, many of these pathogens are known only from molecular-based studies. We provide ultrastructural data supported by molecular phylogeny for a common microsporidium infecting the Daphnia longispina complex, important planktonic filter-feeders in reservoirs and ponds in the temperate Holarctic region. This parasite, previously characterized only by molecular means, infects adipose cells around the Daphnia midgut and eventually fills the centre of the host body with ovoid-shaped spores. A new micro-sporidian genus and species belonging to the Agglomeratidae superclade is described as Pseudoberwaldia daphniae gen. et sp. nov. Molecular data indicate its widespread presence in Central European reservoirs (reported as isolate "MIC1") but also in Swedish coastal rockpools ("Angskars-klubben"). The most closely related lineage was reported from a caddisfly larva; we thus speculate that this taxon may have an insect secondary host in its life cycle. Morphological characterization and differential diagnosis of most commonly encountered microsporidian taxa infecting hosts in the D. longispina complex in Europe opens new possibilities for studies of their ecological and evolutionary interactions.

BAKER, 1942 (HELICOIDEA) FROM MEXICO	MALACOLOGIA			English	Article						semi-slug; biodiversity; Helicoidea; Mexico; 16S rRNA mtDNA; 28S rRNA	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; GASTROPODA; PULMONATA; SEQUENCE; SLUGS	We describe a new helicoidean semi-slug based on morphological and molecular evidence. The new species belongs to the genus Bunnya and is described from a small agricultural area in Zinacantepec, San Juan de las Huertas, Mexico. The genus Bunnya is externally similar to Xanthonyx, another Helicoidea genus; both genera have similar shell and body form, and both have a tail horn. Internally, Bunnya is similar to Humboldtiana, since both have dart-sacs (3 in Bunnya, 3-4 in Humboldtiana) surrounding the vagina, two dart-bulbs associated with each dart sac, and a gland number similar to the dart-sacs number. Four adult specimens of Bunnya metli n. sp. were dissected and compared with the two described species: B. bemardinae from Cuajimalpa, Mexico City, and B. naranjoe from Sierra de Manantlan, Jalisco. Bunnya metli n. sp. is characterized by: very closely-spaced radial riblets (about 23 per mm) crossed by fine spiral wavy threads on the embryonic whorls; unfused glands inserted on the vagina above the dart-sacs and only one dart per sac; a short, swollen penis with a large spherical verge about half the penis size; an elongated bursa copulatrix with a slight constriction in the middle; a long bursa copulatrix duct; and dart sacs with a muscular pad within the vaginal lumen, surrounding the basal part of the genitalia. We performed a phylogenetic analyses using data from fragments of 16S rRNA mtDNA and 28S rRNA genes from one of the collected specimens, as well as other helicoidean sequences from GenBank. Our analyses support the membership of Bunnya metli n. sp. in Xanthonychidae. This suggests that the taxonomic position of Bunnya in Humboldtianidae or Xanthonychidae warrants reevaluation.

J	Bonifacio, P; Menot, L				Bonifacio, Paulo; Menot, Lenaick			New genera and species from the Equatorial Pacific provide phylogenetic insights into deep-sea Polynoidae (Annelida)	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						deep sea; identification key; molecular systematics; morphology; new genera; new species; phylogeny; Polychaeta	SCALE-WORM POLYCHAETA; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; HYDROTHERMAL RIFT-AREA; OXIDASE SUBUNIT-I; SP NOV.; WESTERN MEXICO; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; ADDITIONAL RECORDS; EPIBENTHIC-SLEDGE; NORTHEAST PACIFIC	Polynoidae contains 900 species within 18 subfamilies, some of them restricted to the deep sea. Macellicephalinae is the most diverse among these deep-sea subfamilies. In the abyssal Equatorial Pacific Ocean, the biodiversity of benthic communities is at stake in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) owing to increased industrial interest in polymetallic nodules. The records of polychaetes in this region are scarce. Data gathered during the JPI Oceans cruise SO239 made a significant contribution to fill this gap, with five different localities sampled between 4000 and 5000 m depth. Benthic samples collected using an epibenthic sledge or a remotely operated vehicle resulted in a large collection of polynoids. The aims of this study are as follows: (1) to describe new species of deep-sea polynoids using morphology and molecular data (COI, 16S and 18S); and (2) to evaluate the monophyly of Macellicephalinae. Based on molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses, ten subfamilies are synonymized with Macellicephalinae in order to create a homogeneous clade determined by the absence of lateral antennae. Within this clade, the Anantennata clade was well supported, being determined by the absence of a median antenna. Furthermore, 17 new species and four new genera are described, highlighting the high diversity hidden in the deep. A taxonomic key for the 37 valid genera of the subfamily Macellicephalinae is provided.

Integrative taxonomy unravels cryptic diversity in the Paratrichodorus hispanus-group complex and resolves two new species of the genus and the molecular phylogeny of the family (Nematoda: Trichodoridae)	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						approximately unbiased and ShimodairaHasegawa tests; Bayesian inference; cryptic species; cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1; expansion domains of the large ribosomal subunit (28S); internal transcriber spacer; rRNA; stubby root nematodes	RIBOSOMAL DNA; STUBBY-ROOT; DIPHTHEROPHORINA; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSTICS; SYSTEMATICS; LENGTH; TREE; RNA	The genus Paratrichodorus currently comprises 26 species of polyphagous ectoparasitic plant nematodes that are distributed worldwide and include a few tobravirus vector species. Paratrichodorus is one of the most difficult genera for species identification because it is phenotypically conserved, with morphometric characters that often overlap between species. From 2003 to 2016, nematode surveys were conducted in southern Spain, and the present study addresses 22 nematode populations of the Paratrichodorus hispanus group. Among them, two new species, Paratrichodorus almadenensis sp. nov. and Paratrichodorus ramblensis sp. nov., are described here morphologically and molecularly and compared with topotype specimens of Paratrichodorus hispanus. Furthermore, this analysis was complemented with the first molecular data for this species complex and for the genus Monotrichodorus. The phylogeny of family Trichodoridae showed the relationship of Monotrichodorus with Trichodorus, both of which are phylogenetically associated with the P. hispanus species group, including the two newly described species. Several phylogenetic hypotheses about the monophyly of the genera with molecular data composing the family Trichodoridae were tested using ShimodairaHasegawa and approximately unbiased tests. This work also includes the first observations of copulatory plugs in Paratrichodorus, which clearly differ from the different types of mating plugs described in Trichodorus species.

J	Mannion, PD; Upchurch, P; Schwarz, D; Wings, O				Mannion, Philip D.; Upchurch, Paul; Schwarz, Daniela; Wings, Oliver			Taxonomic affinities of the putative titanosaurs from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania: phylogenetic and biogeographic implications for eusauropod dinosaur evolution	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						BioGeoBEARS; biogeography; Central Gondwanan Desert; dispersal; extended implied weights; Gondwana; Mesozoic; Rebbachisauridae; regional extinction; Titanosauria	SUUWASSEA-EMILIEAE SAUROPODA; ALAMOSAURUS-SANJUANENSIS SAUROPODA; RAPETOSAURUS-KRAUSEI SAUROPODA; LOHAN CURA FORMATION; MORRISON FORMATION; SP-NOV.; REBBACHISAURID DINOSAURIA; NORTHWESTERN PATAGONIA; VERTEBRAL LAMINAE; BAURU GROUP	The Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania, southeastern Africa, records a rich sauropod fauna, including the diplodocoids Dicraeosaurus and Tornieria, and the brachiosaurid titanosauriform Giraffatitan. However, the taxonomic affinities of other sympatric sauropod taxa are poorly understood. Here, we critically reassess and redescribe these problematic taxa, and present the largest phylogenetic analysis for sauropods (117 taxa scored for 542 characters) to explore their placement in Eusauropoda. Janenschia robusta has played a prominent role in discussions of titanosaur origins, with various authors referring at least some remains to Titanosauria, a clade otherwise known only from the Cretaceous. Redescription of the holotype of Janenschia, and all referable remains, supports its validity and placement as a non-neosauropod eusauropod. It forms a clade with Haestasaurus from the earliest Cretaceous of the UK, and the Middle/Late Jurassic Chinese sauropod Bellusaurus. Phylogenetic analysis and CT scans of the internal pneumatic tissue structure of Australodocus bohetii tentatively support a non-titanosaurian somphospondylan identification, making it the only known pre-Cretaceous representative of that clade. New information on the internal pneumatic tissue structure of the dorsal vertebrae of the enigmatic Tendaguria tanzaniensis, coupled with a full redescription, results in its novel placement as a turiasaur. Tendaguria is the sister taxon of Moabosaurus, from the Early Cretaceous of North America, and is the first turiasaur recognized from Gondwana. A previously referred caudal sequence cannot be assigned to Janenschia and displays several features that indicate a close relationship with MiddleLate Jurassic East Asian mamenchisaurids. It can be diagnosed by six autapomorphies, so we erect the new taxon Wamweracaudia keranjei gen. et sp. nov. The presence of a mamenchisaurid in the Late Jurassic of southern Gondwana indicates an earlier and more widespread diversification of this clade than previously realized, prior to the geographic isolation of East Asia. Our revised phylogenetic dataset sheds light on the evolutionary history of Eusauropoda, including supporting a basal diplodocoid placement for Haplocanthosaurus, and elucidating the interrelationships of rebbachisaurids. The Tendaguru Formation shares representatives of nearly all sauropod lineages with Middle Jurassicearliest Cretaceous global faunas, but displays a greater range of diversity than any of those faunas considered individually. Biogeographic analysis indicates that the Tendaguru sauropod fauna was assembled as a result of three main phenomena during the late Early and/or Middle Jurassic: (1) invasions from Euramerica (brachiosaurids, turiasaurs); (2) endemism in west Gondwana (dicraeosaurids, diplodocids); and (3) regional extinctions that restricted the ranges of once widespread groups (mamenchisaurids, the Janenschia lineage). Multiple dispersals across the Central Gondwanan Desert are required to explain the distributions of Jurassic sauropods, suggesting that this geographic feature was at most a filter barrier that became easier to cross during the late Middle Jurassic.

Cercarial fauna of freshwater snails in selected agricultural areas in Laguna, Philippines	HELMINTHOLOGIA			English	Article						Trematodes; cercarial infection; freshwater snails; Laguna; Philippines	CENTROCESTUS-FORMOSANUS NISHIGORI; MELANOIDES-TUBERCULATA; SCHISTOSOMA-JAPONICUM; INFECTION; TREMATODE; HOST; HETEROPHYIDAE; PROVINCE; TAICHUI; SAMAR	Freshwater snails serve as one of trematodes' intermediate hosts. Previous studies on trematode larval stages in the Philippines have largely focused on species with public health importance. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of cercarial morphotypes in several freshwater snail species found in different habitat types (rice field, irrigation canals, and residential area) in selected agricultural areas in Los Banos and Bay in Laguna. Cercarial emergence was induced through exposure to artificial light. A total of 2,720 freshwater snails were collected and were represented by seven species, namely, Melanoides tuberculata Muller 1774 (n = 1229), Radix quadrasi von Moellendorf (n = 630), Tarebia granifera Lamarck, 1816 (n = 417), Pomacea canaliculata Lamarck 1819 (n = 257), Vivipara angularis philippinensis Nevill (n = 18), Stenomelania sp. (n = 104), Thiara scabra Muller 1774 (n = 65). A 2.57 % over-all prevalence was recorded; the infected snail species were M. tuberculata (2.21 %), R. quadrasi (0.21 %), T. granifera (0.11 %). Four cercarial morphotypes, namely, Parapleurolophocercous cercaria (1.80 %), Virgulate xiphidiocercaria (0.26 %), Megaluruous cercaria (0.29 %), and Echinostome cercaria (0.22 %) were recovered from the infected snail species. Prevalence of cercarial infection was significantly different (p < 0.05) among habitat types.	[Paller, V. G. V.; Macaraig, J. R. M.; Verona, R. T.; Estano, L.

SP CESTODA; EUCESTODA HYMENOLEPIDIDAE; PARAECHINUS-AETHIOPICUS; RODENTIA; PARASITE; DIFFERENTIATION; ENDOPARASITES; MURIDAE; SHREWS; SOREX	The cestode Hymenolepis erinacei is regarded as a widely distributed parasite in European hedgehogs of the genus Erinaceus, although the taxonomic position of this hymenolepidid has been debated for a considerable period of time. We present the first molecular data for this cestode, including partial DNA sequences of mitochondrial 16S and nuclear 28S ribosomal genes. Molecular phylogenetic analysis clusters H. erinacei in one clade together with representatives of the genus Hymenolepis from rodents. Characteristic morphological features, including the oval embryophore without filaments and shape of the embryonic hooks of H. erinacei are described. Features of these cestode eggs are proposed as a basis for non-invasive detection of parasitic infections in small mammal populations. The present study explores phylogenetic relationships within the genus Hymenolepis and the host switching related to H. erinacei. Cases of host switching in other genera of the family Hymenolepididae are reviewed. A short critical review of cestodes parasitizing hedgehogs in the Palaearctic is presented.

Diaphorocleidus jaymedeloyolai n. sp. is characterized by a male copulatory organ (MCO) possessing three counterclockwise coils; similar anchors with subtriangular superficial roots; a ventral bar with posteromedial projection; and hooks of pairs 1, 4 and 7 approximately three times longer than hook pair 5. Diaphorocleidus sclerocolpus n. sp. differs from its congeners by a dual-branched accessory piece articulated with the MCO and a sclerotized tubular vagina with a bottle-shaped vestibule. Rhinoxenoides n. gen. is proposed and is characterized by possessing: MCO sclerotized with clockwise coils; an accessory piece articulated to the base of MCO; a sinistroventral vaginal aperture; ventral anchor with conspicuous roots; dorsal anchor with superficial root five times longer than deep root; and absence of dorsal bar. The proposal of Rhinoxenoides n. gen. is also supported by its phylogenetic relationship with Protorhinoxenus prochilodi and species of Rhinoxenus, using 16 morphological characters, which resulted in the following hypothesis of sister-group relationships: Rhinoxenoides n. gen.

The new species is assigned to Parapharyngodon based on the presence of non-embryonated eggs with sub-terminal opercula, when in the ovijector. Parapharyngodon politoedi belongs to a group of species with three pairs of cloacal papillae and differs from its congeners by morphometric aspects, such as the length of the spicule, and the combination of the following morphological characters: ovaries never encircling the oesophagus, tail shape in females, cloacal lips, sharply pointed spicule and presence of genital cone. This is the second species of nematode reported to parasitize O. taurinus and the eleventh species of Parapharyngodon from hylids in the Neotropical region.	[Santos, T. A. P.; Argolo, E. G.

(Panagrolaimomorpha, Steinernematidae), a new entomopathogenic nematode species from Florida, USA	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article							DIAPREPES-ABBREVIATUS COLEOPTERA; SP RHABDITIDA; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; CITRUS; SEQUENCES; SOIL; CURCULIONIDAE; CEPHALOBINA; TRAVASSOS	In this study, molecular (ribosomal sequence data), morphological and cross-hybridization properties were used to identify a new Steinernema sp. from Florida, USA. Molecular and morphological data provided evidence for placing the novel species into Clade V, or the 'glaseri-group' of Steinernema spp. Within this clade, analysis of sequence data of the rDNA genes, 28S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS), depicted the novel species as a distinctive entity and closely related to S. glaseri and S. cubanum. Additionally, cross-hybridization assays showed that the new species is unable to interbreed with either of the latter two species, reinforcing its uniqueness from a biological species concept standpoint. Key morphological diagnostic characters for S. khuongi n. sp. include the mean morphometric features of the third-stage infective juveniles: total body length (average: 1066 mu m), tail length (average: 65 mu m), location of the excretory pore (average: 80.5 mu m) and the values of c (average: 16.4), D% (average: 60.5), E% (average: 126) and H% (average: 46.6). Additionally, males can be differentiated from S. glaseri and S. cubanum by the values of several ratios: D% (average: 68), E% (average: 323) and SW% (average: 120). The natural distribution of this species in Florida encompasses both natural areas and citrus groves, primarily in shallow groundwater ecoregions designated as 'flatwoods'. The morphological, molecular, phylogenetic and ecological data associated with this nematode support its identity as a new species in the S. glaseri-group.	[Stock, S.

The root-knot nematode species Meloidogyne daklakensis n. sp. was discovered on the roots of Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner) in Dak Lak Province, Vietnam. This species is characterized by the females having rounded or oval perineal patterns, smooth, regular, continuous striae, and reduced lateral lines. The dorsal arch is low, rounded and encloses a quite distinct vulva and tail tip. The stylet is normally straight with well-developed and posteriorly sloped knobs. The males have a rounded cap that extends posteriorly into the lip region. The procorpus is outlined distinctly, and is three times longer than the metacorpus. The metacorpus is ovoid, with a strong valve apparatus. The species closely resembles M. marylandi, M. naasi, M. ovalis, M. panyuensis, M. lopezi, M. mali and M. baetica in the perineal pattern of the females, and the morphology of the males and the second-stage juveniles. Nonetheless, it can be differentiated from other species by a combination of morphometric, morphological and molecular characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rDNA as well as the region between the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome c oxidase II (COII) mitochondrial genes. Herein, this nematode is described, illustrated, and designated as a new species, Meloidogyne daklakensis sp. n., based on morphometric, morphological and molecular analyses.	[Trinh, Q. P.; Le, T. M.

As by-catch from collections by arachnologists, 31 specimens of Sphaerotheriida from Laos became available for study. The sample included 14 species. Three species were only represented by females, which are described but cannot be named. Of the remaining 11 species, a single species belongs to the genus Zephronia Gray, 1832: Z. laotica n. sp.; and the other ten belong to the genus Sphaerobelum Verhoeff, 1924: S. bolavensis n. sp., S. phouloei n. sp., S. denticulatum n. sp., S. spinatum n. sp., S. lachneeis n. sp., S. peterjaegeri n. sp., S. nigrum n. sp., S. splendidum n. sp., S. laoticum n. sp., and S. schwendingeri n. sp. This more than doubles the known diversity of Sphaerobelum. Here, I integratively describe these species, combining morphology and DNA barcodes with a molecular analysis including all Zephroniidae species deposited on GenBank-including the only giant pill-millipede species known from Cambodia, Zephronia dawydoffi Attems, 1953. An updated determination key to the species of the genus is presented. Zephronia laotica n. sp. belongs to the monophyletic Zephronia sensu stricto group, which is confirmed by molecular barcoding. In contrast, most species of Sphaerobelum are in a weakly supported Glade. Genetically, Sphaerobelum species differ greatly from one another, with most p-distances >15%. The lowest observed p-distance (9.8%) is between S. truncatum Wongthamwanich et al. 2012 from Thailand and S. peterjaegeri n. sp.

(Sphenophyllales), from the upper Devonian of South Africa	ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION			English	Article						Sphenopsid; Famennian; Devonian; Biogeography; Gondwana; Witpoort formation	WITPOORT FORMATION; PHYLOGENY; FOSSIL; PLANT; HAMATOPHYTON; EVOLUTION; ANATOMY	A rich and diverse plant assemblage has been excavated from latest Devonian (Famennian) black shales of the Witpoort Formation (Witteberg Group) at Waterloo Farm, close to the city of Grahamstown (South Africa). Several specimens of a new sphenopsid have been collected. The description of this as a new taxon, here named Rinistachya hilleri, gen. et sp. nov., provides an important addition to the scarce early record of the group. Rinistachya hilleri presents a novel architecture that include apparently plesiomorphic characters, reminiscent of the organisation of the Iridopteridales (including the production of two types of laterals at one node, the location of fertile parts in loose whorls on lateral branches and an organisation of the fertile parts in which they branch several times before bearing distally elongate sporangia). Other characters unambiguously nest Rinistachya within the Sphenopsida (including presence of planate and slightly webbed ultimate appendages and lateral strobili made of successive whorls of fertile leaves with fertile parts located at their axil). This provides strong support for a close relationship between Sphenopsida and Iridopteridales. Rinistachya furthermore represents the first record of a Devonian sphenopsid from Gondwana and extends the known distribution of the Sphenopsida from the tropics to very high palaeolatitudes. It is a new sphenopsid with a peculiar organisation. The new taxon allows better characterization of the initial evolutionary radiation at the base of the group.

Except of a first survey on Sao Tome in the 19th century, its Orthoptera fauna has never been studied systematically. Here a list of all tettigonioid species which have been recorded from the islands is presented together with information about the bioacoustics and biology of some species. Each archipelago harbours nine species, but only two species are found in both parts of the country. Two species and one subgenus are described as new: Adapantus (Adapantus) excavates sp. nov., Brachyamytta bombomensis sp. nov., Neoadapantus subg. nov. The following nomenclatural changes had to be done: Corycoides greet (Krauss, 1890) becomes new synonym of Corycoides paradoxus (Bolivar, 1890), Xiphidion guineensis Redtenbacher, 1891, Xiphidion africanum Redtenbacher, 1891 and Conocephalus inequalis Uvarov, 1928 become new synonyms of Conocephalus iris Serville, 1838.

A new species of eolepadid stalked barnacle, Vulcanolepas fijiensis sp. nov., was collected from a hydrothermal vent in the North Fiji Basin, Southwestern Pacific Ocean, at a depth of 1988 m. Based on morphological characteristics, this new species was distinguished from its relatives, V. osheai Buckeridge, 2000, V parensis Southward, 2005, V. scotiaensis Buckeridge, Linse & Jackson, 2013, and V. buckeridgei Chan & Chang, 2018. Based on morphological characteristics, Vulcanolepas species are divided mainly into two groups by the size of the first mandibular tooth; the first group has a large mandibular first tooth (V. parensis, V. scotiaensis, and V. fijiensis sp. nov., the second a small mandibular first tooth (V. osheai and V. buckeridgei). The new species can be easily distinguished from V. parensis and V. scotiaensis by the length ratio of antenniform segments to robust segments of the rami of cirrus I. Vulcanolepas fijiensis sp. nov. also differs from V. parensis by the length ratio of the penis and cirrus VI (1/10 vs 1/4), and the extension the carinal apex to the tergum (extended vs not extended). Additionally, the sequence divergence of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene between V. fijiensis sp. nov. and the other neolepadid species (except V. parensis from its original locations) ranged from 4.2% to 14.0%. In a neighbor-joining tree, V. fijiensis sp. nov. formed an independent branch. These results infer that V. fijiensis sp. nov. is a new species, distinct from the other known neolepadids.

The analyzed specimens of Condyloderes shirleyi sp. nov. showed a significant variation of numerous morphological characters, along with female-specific traits known also from other congeneric species. These findings stimulated the re-investigation of the type material of the six species of Condyloderes described so far, i.e., C. kurilensis Adrianov & Maiorova, 2016, C. megastigma Sorensen, Rho & Kim, 2010b, C. multispinosus (McIntyre, 1962) Higgins, 1969, C. paradoxus Higgins, 1969, C. setoensis Adrianov, Murakami & Shirayama, 2002, and C. storchi Higgins, 2004 in Martorelli & Higgins, 2004. Our study allowed to reveal various morphological novelties and to emend the diagnosis of these species and of the genus Condyloderes. Furthermore, our analysis led to synonymize C. megastigma with C. setoensis. The results of our investigation about the significant variation in C. shirleyi sp. nov. raise a wider question on species identity within Kinorhyncha, underscoring the necessity, if possible, to describe new species from a higher number of specimens and to concentrate on the morphological variation of the going-to-be-described species.

A cladistic analysis based on morphology, showed that the new genus is the sister-group of Heliconilla Dankittipakul, Jocque & Singtripop, 2012 with which it shares the granulated carapace with branched setae and the marbled ventral abdominal pattern, but differs by the abdominal, tubular sclerotized protrusion around the pedicel in males and the absence of posterior ventral abdominal spines in the female. The type species Cambonilla securicula Jocque gen. et sp. nov. was found in rainforest along the Mekong River in Cambodia and Laos.

New species of Australian microgastrine parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Microgastrinae) documented through the 'Bush Blitz' surveys of national reserves	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Dolichogenidea; Choer as; Sathon; biodiversity; inventory; bushblitz	APANTELES FOERSTER; SYSTEMATICS; GENERA; CHINA; MASON; KEY	The braconid subfamily Microgastrinae are ecologically important parasitoids of larval lepidopterans, but are poorly studied in many regions of the world. In this study, we focus on describing new species of microgastrine wasps, in part from specimens collected on six different 'Bush Blitz' surveys of regional reserves in South Australia and Tasmania. Ten species of Microgastrinae are described as new and DNA barcodes of the genes COl and wingless are provided: three species in the genus Choeras Mason: C. bushblitz Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., C. parvoculus Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., and C. zygon Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov.; six species in the genus Dolichogenidea Viereck: D. bonbonensis Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., D. brabyi Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., D. forrestae Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., D. garytaylori Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., D. kelleri Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov., and D. lobesiae Fagan-Jeffiies & Austin sp. nov.; and one species from the genus Sathon Mason: S. oreo Fagan-Jeffries & Austin sp. nov. These new species represent just a small fraction of the potential of 'Bush Blitz' surveys in regional Australia, which provide DNA-quality material allowing an integrative taxonomic approach and offer a window into the biodiversity of some of the least studied areas of the continent.

J	Borkent, A				Borkent, Art			The phylogenetic relationships of Cretaceous biting midges, with a key to all known genera (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)	AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES			English	Article							BURMESE AMBER	The phylogenetic positions of Cretaceous species of Ceratopogonidae previously placed in the genera Archiculicoides Szadziewski, Protoculicoides Boesel, and Atriculicoides Remm are reappraised in light of synapomorphies. Character states are discussed in detail, supported by new photographs of Protoculicoides depressus Boesel, the description of Protoculicoides revelatus, n. sp., from Burmese amber, and a compilation of previously published illustrations. The recent article by Szadziewski et al. (2016) proposing that Protoculicoides and Atriculicoides are congeneric is shown to be inaccurate. At least three separate lineages are represented by species in these two genera, requiring a new genus, Gerontodacus (type species, G. succineus (Szadziewski)), to include some of them. Archiculicoides, Protoculicoides, Gerontodacus, Adelohelea Borkent and Alautunmyia Borkent remain undetermined to subfamily. As a result of phylogenetic and other taxonomic considerations, the following are new combinations: Gerontodacus krzeminskii (Choufani, Azar, and Nel), Gerontodacus punctus (Borkent), Gerontodacus skalskii (Szadziewski and Arillo), Archiaustroconops andersoni (Szadziewski, Ross, and Gilka), Atriculicoides ciliatus (Borkent), Atriculicoides hispanicus (Szadziewski and Arillo), Atriculicoides sanjusti (Szadziewski and Arillo) and Adelohelea burmitica (Szadziewski and Poinar). The following species are returned to the genera they were assigned to before Szadziewski et al. (2016): Atriculicoides cenomanensis Szadziewski and Schluter, Atriculicoides dasyheleis Szadziewski, Atriculicoides globosus (Boesel), Atriculicoides incompletus Szadziewski and Schluter, Atriculicoides macrophthalmus Remm, Atriculicoides sibiricus Szadziewski, Atriculicoides swinhoei (Cockerell), Atriculicoides szadziewskii Perez-de la Fuente, Delclos, Penalver, and Arillo and Atriculicoides taimyricus Szadziewski.

A new genus and species of Acanthopidae with sexually dimorphic cryptic strategies (Insecta: Mantodea)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Amazon; Dictyoptera; Praying mantises; Sexual Dimorphism; Taxonomy	PRAYING-MANTISES; SIZE DIMORPHISM; MORPHOLOGY; THESPIDAE; REVISION	Praying mantises (Mantodea) are distinct for their rich diversity of cryptic adaptations. Among the many strategies, dry leaf mimicry have evolved multiple times in unrelated lineages from different zoogeographic regions, among them the Neotropical Acanthopidae. Here we describe Metacanthops fuscum n. gen. et n. sp. based on male and female specimens from the Brazilian Amazon. The recognition of this new acanthopid lineage revealed that Acanthops amazonica Beier, 1930 (currently assigned to Metilia Stal) is a member of Metacanthops and thus we transfer this species, now referable to as Metacanthops amazonica (Beier, 1930) n. comb., redescribe the holotype, and provide new data on its distribution in Brazil and French Guiana. Metacanthops is closely related to Metilia, from which its number of forefemoral posteroventral spines, head and compound eye shape, pronotal configuration, wings features, and the entirely brown habitus of males, can distinguish it. We highlight some aspects of sexual dimorphism in Metacanthops fuscum in relation to their dimorphic cryptic strategies, where males resemble a dry leaf and females a lichenous twig. We additionally establish five recently published names under genus Metilia as nomina nuda.	[Agudelo, Antonio A.

The new species can be distinguished from its congeners by the following combination of characters: branched dorsal-fin rays 8-9; branched pectoral-fm rays 8-9; branched pelvic-fm rays 5; branched anal-fin rays 5; vertebrae 4+37; snout length 45.5-50.1% of head length; postdorsal length 39.0-42.8% of standard length; caudal-peduncle depth/caudal-peduncle length range from 56.4% to 71.9%; the posterior chamber of the gas bladder degenerated; body elongated, covered by scattered scales; eyes present and normal in size, not reduced or absent; and a complete lateral line. A phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene resolved Triplophysa sanduensis as sister to Triplophysa longliensis. Kimura's 2-parameter genetic distance of the COI gene sequences between these two species was 1.9%.

Morphological and molecular analyses reveal a new species of stygobitic amphipod in the genus Crangonyx (Crustacea: Crangonyctidae) from Jackson County, Florida, with a redescription of Crangonyx floridanus and notes on its taxonomy and biogeography	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						18S rDNA; 28S rDNA; 16S rDNA; caves; Floridan aquifer; Crangonyx manubrium	EVOLUTION; MITOCHONDRIAL; GAMMARIDAE; CAVES; RDNA	Crangonyx manubrium, a new stygobitic species, is described from hypogean localities in Jackson County, Florida. This analysis is based on detailed morphometric and genetic comparisons of Jackson County Cave populations with epigean populations of Crangonyx floridanus, including paratypes from Highlands Hammock State Park, the type locality of C. floridanus. The original description of C. floridanus was partially based on a population from Gerard's Cave, in Jackson County, which is now assigned to C. manubrium n. sp. Crangonyx floridanus is morphologically redescribed based on paratype material from Highlands Hammock State Park, Highlands County, Florida and a population from Hogtown Creek in Gainesville, Alachua County, Florida. Molecular and morphological analyses show surprising variation across the range of C. floridanus, indicating it may represent a species complex.

Tylototriton panwaensis sp. nov. is most closely related to T. verrucosus + T. shanjing but bears a unique suite of colour pattern and morphological characters separating it from T. verrucosus and T. shanjing as well as the other geographically proximate species T. ngarsuensis and T. shanorum. Molecular and morphological data presented herein (that have been used elsewhere) continue to fuel the issue of separate specific allocation (or not) to T. verrucosus and T. shanjing but go no further to resolve the controversy.

Thanks to several years spent exploring mangroves in the Indo-West Pacific (more than 260 stations), especially in South-East Asia, the diversity of mangrove gastropods can now be addressed through revisions following an integrative taxonomy approach (nomenclature, field observations, comparative anatomy and DNA sequences). A new genus of onchidiid slugs is described, Paromoionchis Dayrat & Goulding gen. nov., which includes five species, three of which are new: Paromoionchis boholensis Dayrat & Goulding gen. et sp. nov., P. daemelii (Semper, 1880) com. nov., P. goslineri Dayrat & Goulding gen. et sp. nov., P. penangensis Dayrat & Goulding gen. et sp. nov. and P. tumidus (Semper, 1880) comb. nov. Paromoionchis gen. nov. is distributed from western India to the subtropical waters of Japan (33 degrees N) and southeastern Australia (33 degrees S). The creation of new taxon names is supported by rigorous nomenclature: the types of all existing species names in the family were examined, the original descriptions carefully studied and nomenclatural issues addressed. The diversity and biogeography of this new genus is discussed in a broader context.

One of these (now considered lost) came from the "Rocher du Goulet" at the base of the Biarritz section (Bartonian, Cote des Basques, southwest France). D'Archiac figured only the second cup; this belongs to the d'Orbigny Collection and is still housed in the palaeontological collection of the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris) as the lectotype of the species, C. thorenti. It appears that it was collected from Priabonian levels exposed near Castellane (Alpes de Haute Provence, southeast France). New observations on this cup, as well as a detailed study of the characters of aboral cups, columnals and proximal brachials in a few extant and fossil species classically attributed to Conocrinus or to closely related genera such as Democrinus, Rhizocrinus and Tormocrinus, have yielded arguments for a revision of the taxonomy and interrelationships of extant and fossil taxa in the family Bourgueticrinidae. Conocrinus (= Tormocrinus), as here interpreted, includes six Eocene species: C. thorenti, C. archiaci, C. cahuzaci n. sp., C. duperrieri, C. cf suessi and C. veronensis. Numerous extinct species previously attributed to Conocrinus or Democrinus are here transferred to two new genera which first occur in the lower Paleocene: Paraconocrinus n. gen. (type species: P pyriformis) and Pseudoconocrinus n. gen. (type species: P doncieuxi). Aboral cups from the "Rocher du Goulet" (Biarritz) are here assigned to Paraconocrinus pellati n. gen., n. sp., while the Danian species Democrinus maximus is transferred to Pseudoconocrinus n. gen. A new genus, Cherbonniericrinus, is created to accommodate a single extant species, Ch. cherbonnieri, previously attributed to Conocrinus, while the extant genus Rhizocrinus, closely related to Democrinus, is resurrected. Conocrinus and closely related genera are derived from a bourgueticrinine lineage the first record of which is from the lower Campanian, with the new genus Carstenicrinus. These are all attributed to the family Rhizocrinidae which is here considered distinct from the family Bourgueticrinidae. Rhizocrinids rapidly diversified immediately after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) event. Cretaceous taxa previously placed within the family Bourgueticrinidae now appear to be polyphyletic. Some of them do not belong to Bourgueticrinina, such as those of the Dunnicrinus lineage. Interrelationships of Rhizocrinidae and other post-Palaeozoic families having a xenomorphic stalk are discussed.

To date, there are 17 valid species, however, only one species has been previously recorded in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of the genus occurring along the Northeast and Southeast coasts and sublittoral areas of Brazil. Three new species have been found in samples collected in a variety of habitats and depths, Scyphoproctus paivai sp. nov., S. profundus sp. nov., and S. robustus sp. nov. The new species are herein described and compared to other species of the genus and type material of two additional species are re-described, Scyphoproctus oculatus Reish, 1959 and S. pseudoarmatus (Silva 1965). The genus Heteromastides Augener, 1914 is herein relocated in Scyphoproctus Gravier, 1904 and the previous species Heteromastides platyproctus Pillai, 1961 (junior homonym) renamed as Scyphoproctus telesphorei n. nov. after the species author Telesphore Gottfried Pillai, because there is already a species named Scyphoproctus platyproctus Jones, 1961 (senior homonym). A taxonomic key of the valid and new species is also given.

It is sister to the Glade N. livida + N. tessellata, and is phenetically most similar to N. tessellata, from which it differs in its more elongate body and possibly increased number of presacral vertebrae and patternless orange dorsal coloration. The form elegans, described as a species by Andrew Smith (1838), but treated as an infrasubspecific variant by Broadley (1972), also exhibits weak patterning, but is likely a regional color variant. Nucras aurantiaca sp. nov. is the ninth member of the genus found in southern Africa. Its discovery in the well-collected coastal Western Cape suggests that further herpetofaunal surveys are needed in this region, which is threatened by agricultural activity and tourism-related development.

Review of the leafhopper genus Makilingia Baker (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Mileewinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						Philippines; morphology; biogeography; Makilingiini		The taxonomy of the leafhopper genus Makilingia Baker is reviewed based on comparative morphological study of types and other specimens. Twenty-six species are recognized as valid including ten new species described and illustrated herein: M. davaoensis n. sp. M. lobata n. sp., M. maculamima n. sp., M. nigramima n. sp., M. paranigra n. sp., M. siamensis n. sp., M. tenebrifrons n. sp., M. uncinata n. sp., M. viraktamathi n. sp., and M. xanthopicta n. sp. Makilingia siamensis n. sp. represents the first known occurrence of the genus outside the Philippine Archipelago and the first record for Thailand. Makilingia simillima Baker, n. stat., formerly treated as a variety of M. variabilis Baker, is elevated to full species status based on distinctive differences in the male genitalia. Lectotypes are designated for several species described by Baker. The male genitalia of these species are described and illustrated for the first time and a key to all known species is provided.

The bulk of the specimens interpreted here is of Swedish origin. Species described as new to science are Desertepidosis grytsjoenensis sp. nov. (from Sweden), D. robusta sp. nov. (Sweden), Linnaeomyia pratensis sp. nov. (Czech Republic), Neurepidosis ekdalensis sp. nov. (Sweden), N. emarginata sp. nov. (Sweden, Czech Republic), N. hybrida sp. nov. (Sweden), Tetraneuromyia brevipalpis sp. nov. (Sweden, Slovak Republic), T. discrepans sp. nov. (Sweden), T. errata sp. nov. (Sweden), and T. lapponica sp. nov. (Sweden). A new genus, Gardenforsia gen. nov., is introduced for G. oelandica sp. nov. (Sweden), a new species with regressive male morphology. The generic definitions of Desertepidosis Mamaev & Soyunov, 1989 (including Ubinomyia Mamaev, 1990 syn. nov. as new junior synonym) and Linnaeomyia Jaschhof & Jaschhof, 2015 are revised. A key to males of Desertepidosis is presented. New information on the morphology and geographic distribution is provided for Linnaeomyia hortensis Jaschhof & Jaschhof, 2015; Tetraneuromyia bulbifera Mamaev, 1964; and T. lamellata Spungis, 1987.

A total of 20 species were found, belonging to 11 genera, from 58 different host plant species, of which one mite genus, Mesobryobia (Wainstein, 1956), and three species, M. terpoghossiani (Bagdasarian, 1959), Georgiobia richteri (Bagdasarian, 1954) and Tetranychus lonicerae Beglyarov & Mitrofanov, 1973, are new mite records to the Ukrainian acarofauna. Moreover, 15 new host plant species were also recorded as new hosts for 10 spider mite species. In addition, thanks to the newly collected material and a taxonomical historical review, and according to morphological data, we restore the genus Georgiobia Wainstein, 1960, and provide a new diagnosis of this genus. Therefore, a list of several new and reinstated combinations is provided. Finally, a new species, G skuthiae n. sp., collected in the reserve on Agropyron sp., is described and illustrated, increasing the number of species that belong to the genus Georgiobia to nine.

J	Freitas-Silva, RAP; Ale-Rocha, R				Freitas-Silva, Rafael A. P.; Ale-Rocha, Rosaly			New South American species of Crossopalpus Bigot (Diptera: Hybotidae: Tachydromiinae), including biogeographical insights and a reinterpretation of female abdominal tergite 10 in Drapetidini	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Empidoidea; Drapetidini; Neotropics; New Word; predaceous flies	EMPIDOIDEA; GENUS; EMPIDIDAE; REVISION; FLIES; FLY	Crossopalpus is a rather diverse genus of tachydromiine flies, but regionally the genus is nowhere very speciose. Knowledge on the South American Crossopalpus before this paper included two described species from Andean related habitats, with several biomes from the eastern part of the continent being completely unexplored. Herein, we describe four new species of Crossopalpus from eastern South America, namely: C. albivertex sp. nov., C. aliceae sp. nov., C. goliathus sp. nov., and C. xanthogaster sp. nov. New diagnoses and high quality photographs are made available for C. armipes (Bezzi, 1909) and C. pennescens (Melander, 1918), including some characters used for the first time to distinguish South American species. We provide a key for identification of the six South American species, discussion about the position of Crossopalpus in Drapetidini, and some biogeographical insights including preferred habitats and seasonality of the South American species. We discuss the apparent loss of tergite 10 in females of Drapetidini, introducing a reinterpretation where the sclerite may be present in some genera of the tribe, but fused to the cerci and/or sternite 10.

Four species of Cancricepon are reported here, and two are new to science. Cancricepon choprae (Nierstrasz & Brender a Brandis, 1925) is reported from the Gulf of Mexico on the Florida coast, infesting a new host, Micropanope cf. sculptipes Stimpson, 1871. Cancricepon castroi n. sp. is described from Australia, the Maldives, Japan and Papua New Guinea parasitizing coral crabs of the family Trapeziidae. Cancricepon cf multituberosum An, Yu & Williams, 2012 is recorded from a specimen of Leptodius affinis (De Haan, 1835) from Taiwan. Specimens previously misidentified as C. choprae parasitizing Scalopidia spinosipes Stimpson, 1858, from China are described as C. beibusinus n. sp. All known hosts and localities of species of Cancricepon are summarized, and a key to the species in the genus is provided. The similarities between species of Cancricepon and the type species of Trapezicepon Bonnier, 1900, are discussed and Trapezicepon thalamitae Markham, 1985, is transferred to Scyracepon Tattersall, 1905.

A new species of inachoidid, Collodes anartius sp. n. is described from Peru, which resembles C. tenuirostris Rathbun, 1893, in the general appearance of the carapace, but is distinguished by the details of tubercles on the carapace and thoracic sternum, proportions of the pereopod articles, and bathymetric distribution. A new epialtid, Nibilia machala sp. n., is described from Ecuador; Nibilia A Milne-Edwards, 1878 has, until now, been considered to be mono-typic, occurring only in the western Atlantic. This new species, from the eastern Pacific, closely resembles N. antilocapra (Stimpson, 1871) in the general morphology, but can be distinguished by the number of spines on the carapace and pereopods. Another epialtid, Solinca aulix gen. n. et sp. n, is establish for material collected from Ecuador and Peru, and can be easily identified from other taxa by the presence of a deep furrow between the very inflated branchial regions.

Ticks (Argasidae, Ixodidae) and tick-borne diseases of continental Southeast Asia	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Continental Southeast Asia; ticks; tick-borne diseases; Ixodidae; Argasidae	SPOTTED-FEVER GROUP; KYASANUR-FOREST-DISEASE; PIROPLASM SURFACE PROTEIN; SANGUINEUS-SENSU-LATO; SP-N IXODOIDEA; MITOCHONDRIAL GENE HETEROGENEITY; BOOPHILUS-MICROPLUS INFESTATION; HAEMAPHYSALIS-SPINIGERA-NEUMANN; BATS CHIROPTERA HIPPOSIDERIDAE; TESTUDINARIUM ACARI IXODIDAE	Knowledge of the tick fauna of continental Southeast Asia is either patchy or, in some cases, for example Cambodia and Myanmar, poor. Nevertheless, 97 species have been recorded from this region, making it one of the most diverse for ticks worldwide. Throughout Southeast Asia, work on tick-borne diseases of stock and companion animals, as well as of humans, is in its infancy, and the medical, veterinary and socio-economic importance of these diseases is largely unknown. Here we review current knowledge of Southeast Asian ticks and tick-borne diseases, with the aim of stimulating further research on this subject.

Uroleucon nahuelhuapense Nieto Nafria & von Dohlen sp. n. is described from apterous viviparous females collected on Adesmia boronioides (Fabaceae) in a locality of Neuquen province (Argentina). The morphological characters and the sequence of the tRNAleu-COII mitochondrial locus support the inclusion of the new species in the genus Uroleucon. Apterous viviparous females of Uroleucon adesmiae Mier Durante & Ortego collected in two Argentinean localities have also been studied and ranges of several quantitative features have been modified. The identification key for the Uroleucon species known in South America by Nieto Nafria et al. (2007) has been modified to include the new species.

Dendrosauridion gen. n. can be distinguished morphologically from all other genera of Cercosaurinae by having the lower palpebral disc transparent and undivided, dorsal scales smooth, lateral scales distinctly smaller than dorsal scales, and lateral scales adjacent to ventrals non-granular, not forming a distinct longitudinal line along body axis. Phenotypic synapomorphies are not known for the new genus. In a previously published phylogeny, Dendrosauridion gen. n. was identified as a distinct Glade separated from all other cercosaurines. The mono-typic genus contains Dendrosauridion yanesha sp. n., which is known from two localities in montane forests of the eastern Andes in central (Region Pasco) and southern Peru (Region Cusco) from 2780 to 2825 m a.s.l. with a distributional gap of 413 km in between. The two adult males (SVL 59.1-60.2 mm) and one juvenile were found in trees. The secretive habits of D. yanesha sp. n. are likely the reason for its rarity and we propose the threat status of the new species as "Data Deficient".

Twenty-two enchytraeid species were recorded and identified. The descriptions of two new species (Achaeta multisacculata sp. n. and Fridericia floriformis sp. n.) are presented in this paper. The main diagnostic features of A. multisacculata sp. n. are: three pairs of pyriform glands per segment, clitellum with two "baguette-like" packages of glands, dorsal blood vessel from VII, secondary pharyngeal glands absent, oesophageal appendages well developed, two pairs of preclitellar nephridia, the reproductive organs (except the spermathecae in V) shifted one segment forward. The main features of F. floriformis sp. n. are that they are large worms, have up to 2-4 chaetae in bundles, strong body wall, thick cuticle, five pairs of preclitellar nephridia, c-type coelomo-mucocytes sometimes with some retractile vesicles, chylus cells in XII-XV, sperm funnels approximately twice as long than wide, spermathecae with long ectal duct without glands, ampullae surrounded distally by about 9-12 sessile diverticula of varying size. Molecular phylogenetic analyses supported the morphological results and confirmed the status of the two new species.

Dibamus manadotuaensis sp. nov. differs from all congeneric species in the following unique combination of characters: maximum snout-vent length 135 mm; tail length up to 14.2 mm (i.e., 12-13% of SVL); labial and nasal sutures present and complete; four (three) postoculars; four to six scales on posterior edge of infralabial; 26-28 midbody scale rows; 30-33 transverse scale rows posterior to head; 25 transverse scale rows anterior to vent; 218-232 ventral scales; 39 subcaudal scales; relative size of frontal to frontonasal 0.68-0.73; relative size of interparietal to surrounding scales 0.67-1.43; 132-135 presacral and 21-24 postsacral vertebrae. Morphologically, D. manadotuaensis is most similar to D. celebensis, which occurs on mainland Sulawesi. Dibamus manadotuaensis sp. nov. represents the twenty-fourth species of Dibamus and the third species of this genus recorded from the Sulawesi region. At the same time, it is the only squamate species considered endemic for the islands of the Bunaken Marine National Park, to which Manado Tua belongs.

J	Nascimento, E; Cavalcanti, T; Pinheiro, U				Nascimento, Elielton; Cavalcanti, Thayna; Pinheiro, Ulisses			A new species of Acanthella Schmidt, 1862 (Porifera, Demospongiae, Dictyonellidae) from northeast region, Brazil	ZOOTAXA			English	Article								Acanthella Schmidt, 1862 species are characterized by choanosomal skeleton of dendritic tracts cored by interwoven sinuously bent strongyles or strongyloxeas and echinated by straight styles, oxeas or anisoxeas (Van Soest et al. 2002). The genus Acanthella comprises 33 valid species, with six known from the Atlantic Ocean (Van Soest et al. 2018). Previously, the only record for Brazil was A. flagelliformis (Van Soest & Stentoft, 1988) (Muricy 2018). Species of the genus include a transition from shrub like Axinellas' and herbaceous species similar to the genus Suberites Nardo, 1833 (Schmidt 1862; Vosmaer 1912). Due to its heterogeneous complex of species, Acanthella has been confused with other axinellids. Similarities were seen in genera such as Phakellia (Van Soest et al. 2002), which shares spicule complement and comparable choanosomal skeletons. In the present study, we describe a new species of Acanthella from oceanographic expeditions of the northeast region of Brazil. Two specimens of Acanthella sp. nov. were collected by dredging at Ceara and Pernambuco State, Brazil. All specimens were preserved in 92% ethanol and deposited in the Porifera Collections at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPEPOR). The taxonomic identification was carried out through analysis of spicules morphologies, using Light Microscopy (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), following methods described by Hajdu et al. (2011).

Cocconeis magnoareolata Al-Handal, Riaux-Gob., R.Jahn & A.K.Wulff sp. nov. is a small species not exceeding 9 mu m in length and characterized by having large subquadrangular areolae on the sternum valve. Cocconeis vrangoensis Al-Handal & Riaux-Gob. sp. nov. appears similar to some taxa of the 'Cocconeis scutellum complex', but differs by its stria density on both valves and variable features of the areola and valvocopula ultrastructure.

Seventy-five localities throughout the Apulia region were sampled and one-quarter of the sampled localities had fig roots infested with H. fici, with population densities ranging from 44 to 180 cysts/100 ml of soil. All attempts to detect H. fici on ornamental Ficus spp. as well as on imported bonsai in Italy were unsuccessful. Morphometric characters of the Italian population conform to those of the type and re-description populations reported for H. fici. Molecular analysis using ITS, D2-D3 expansion domains of the 28S rRNA, and the partial 18S rRNA sequences of H. fici newly obtained in this study matched well with the corresponding sequences of H. fici present in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic trees confirmed and supported the grouping of H. fici in the Humuli group. Heterodera fici completes its embryogenic development in 14-16 days at 25 degrees C. Post-invasion development and maturity in the roots of F carica seedlings is completed in 64-68 days at 25-28 degrees C with juveniles and adults showing different parasitic habits, being endoparasitic and semi-endoparasitic respectively. The establishment of permanent feeding sites that consist of the formation of large syncytia causes anatomical modification of vascular elements and general disorder in the root stelar structures. Syncytia structures associated with mature females showed different degrees of vacuolisation, numbers of syncytial cells, and contained nuclei and nucleoli which were constantly hypertrophied.

The phylogenetic hypothesis based on 16s sequences places the new species as sister to the species group that includes P. natalensis, although it is morphologically more similar to other dwarf Phrynobatrachus species, such as the Ethiopian P. minutus.

Charadrahyla sakbah sp. nov., is distinguished from the rest of the species in the genus by the large body size (81.15-85.75 mm and 67.91-73.21 mm in adult females and males respectively), axillary membrane, adult males with hypertrophied webbings between toes I and II, nuptial excrescences, one enlarged conical tubercle on either side of vent, vocal slits absent, and sexual dimorphism in the snout shape in dorsal profile (rounded and acuminate in females and males respectively). The hypertrophied webbings are a unique character among other hylids of Middle America, and are only present in C. trux, C. tecuani and the species described herein. These three species inhabit the cloud forest of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are probably closely related. However, more detailed phylogenetic analyses are needed to define the internal relationships of the genus. The cloud forest in the Sierra Madre del Sur continues to be known for a high number of endemic species. However, the cloud forest faces several threats due to its limited distribution that make it a priority ecosystem for conservation.

A revision of the mealybug genus Scaptococcus McKenzie (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha: Pseudococcidae), with descriptions of the adult male and female of Scaptococcus occultans sp. n. from the southwestern United States, and the male of S-milleri McKenzie	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Arizona; California; Nevada; New Mexico; Texas; Utah; identification key		The adult female and male of Scaptococcus occultans sp. n. (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha: Pseudococcidae), a new mealybug species from the southwestern United States, are described and illustrated, as well as the male of S. milleri McKenzie. Females of the new species can be recognized by their unmodified prothoracic legs, anal ring with two rows of cellular pores, and presence of a circulus; the adult female is further characterized by the presence of bands across the thoracic and abdominal segments containing numerous dorsal modified oral collar tubular ducts (with the inner half of the outer duct sclerotized), quinquelocular pores and multilocular pores. The adult male of the new species differs from that of S. milleri by having unmodified prothoracic femora, small spine-like prothoracic claw denticles, fewer dorsal and ventral setae on abdominal segments II-V, and no sclerotized abdominal tergites laterally on the abdomen. The generic description of Scaptococcus is revised to include the new species, and an updated key to the adult females, diagnostic notes for the female nymphal instars, and updated distribution and host data for all the three species are provided.

Part 2: genera Austromaera Lowry & Springthorpe, 2005 and Quadrimaera Krapp-Schickel & Ruffo, 2000 (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Maeridae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						taxonomy; Crustacea; Amphipoda; Maeridae; Austromaera; Quadrimaera; Japan; new species	PACIFIC	One species of Austromaera Lowry & Springthorpe, 2005 and four species of Quadrimaera Krapp-Schickel & Ruffo, 2000 included in the Maera Glade, are described from Japan. Austromaera ariakensis sp. nov. is described, based on collections from Ariake Sea and can be distinguished from its congeners by the acutely produced coxa 1 and the merus of gnathopod 2 with a small posterodistal spine. Quadrimaera gotoensis sp. nov. from Goto Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture has a small quadrate excavation on the middle palmar margin of the male gnathopod 2. This new species is different from Q. mirandella Appadoo, Myers & Fagoonee, 2002 having such an excavation, in the larger posterodistal tooth of the male gnathopod 2 propodus and the wider bases of the pereopods 5-7. Quadrimaera pacifica (Schellenberg, 1938) was collected from many localities from Iwate Prefecture to Ariake Sea. This species is characterized by the transverse palm of the male gnathopod 2 with the large posterodistal tooth, the small rounded excavation in the middle and the anterior lobe narrower and produced more distally than the posterior lobe. Morphology of Q. pacifica is variable in the posterior excavation of the male gnathopod 2 palm, the uropod 3 rami and the distal end of the telson. Quadrimaera quadrimana (Dana, 1853) from the south of Yakushima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture has a distinct palm of the male gnathopod 2 with three excavations. Quadrimaera setibasis sp. nov. collected from the intertidal zone in Osaka Prefecture has a setose basis of the pereopod 6 like Q. schellenbergi (Ruffo 1938), but the bases of the pereopods 5 and 7 are not setose. A key to species of Austromaera in the world is provided.

The species is distinguished from other described Megophrys by morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular data of the 12S and 16S mitochondrial loci. The species is characterized by its rotund stature, head length approximately equal to head width, canthus rostralis well developed, tympanum large and distinct, vomerine teeth absent, margin of tongue smooth, not notched from behind, heels of the feet not meeting when femurs are held at 90 degrees to the axis of the body and tibias are depressed against the femur, toes weakly webbed at base, dorsal skin mostly smooth with scattered granules and ridges, usually the presence of two discontinuous dorsolateral ridges, supratympanic fold distinct and well-developed, and with females ranging from 32.8-35 mm snout-to-vent length, and males ranging from 27.4-34.5 mm SVL. In its type locality, the species is sympatric with M. boettgeri and M kuatunensis; and phylogenetically, the most closely related described species is M. obesa from southwest Guangdong province. As more cryptic species are described within the subfamily Megophryinae, the more apparent becomes the need for fine-scale molecular and phenotypic assessment to capture the many forms of this hyper-diverse group.

Based on morphological data, the new species Dugesia bijuga Harrath & Sluys, sp. nov. is characterized mainly by the presence of two diaphragms, a barrel-shaped penis that is traversed by numerous ducts of penis glands and is provided with a short nozzle, and the presence of two atrial folds. The other new species, Dugesia pustulata Harrath & Sluys, sp. nov., is characterized mainly by absence of a penis bulb, presence of a large, elongated and weakly muscular seminal vesicle, and by the ventroposterior section of the bursal canal being thrown into distinct folds. The phylogenetic position of the two new species was determined through a molecular phylogenetic tree, based on a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene, including species from the major geographical range of distribution of the genus Dugesia. The phylogenetic tree revealed that the Cameroon lineage does not constitute a monophyletic group with the other Afrotropical species; it also showed that the African continent may house a great diversity of Dugesia species that still remains to be discovered.

J	Williams, BW; Weaver, PG				Williams, Bronwyn W.; Weaver, Patricia G.			Two new species of Xironogiton (Clitellata: Branchiobdellida) from western North America	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Branchiobdellinae; crayfish worm; ectosymbiont; Pacifastacus	PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS; ANNELIDA CLITELLATA; SIGNAL CRAYFISH; WORMS	Xironogiton, a genus of crayfish worm (order Branchiobdellida), is historically endemic to North America. To date, six species of Xironogiton have been described, including five and one from areas west and east of the Continental Divide, respectively. Recent collections of the crayfishes Pacifastacus connectens and Pacifastacus leniusculus from the endorheic Harney Basin in south-eastern Oregon, USA, revealed the presence of two previously unknown Xironogiton species, which we describe herein. Discovery and characterisation of Xironogiton bibendumi sp. nov. and Xironogiton malheurensis sp. nov. suggests that much work remains to understand branchiobdellidan diversity in western North America, and additional targeted sampling is needed to determine intra- and interspecific variation, and thus define species limits.

Besides the typical stripy red specimens, another form bearing pinkish pigmentation also exists, mostly found in natural habitats in the East Mediterranean. Here we provide the first integrative taxonomic analysis of D. veneta, including some closely related species. Both the morphological and molecular results highly support the resurrection of D. succinta, a former synonym of D. veneta. In addition, we describe a peculiar new species, D. karacadagi sp. n. from Anatolia, and prove the highly homoplasious character of the cross section of the longitudinal musculature.

Additionally, each lineage is discretely diagnosable from one another based on morphology and color pattern and most occur in specific geographic regions (upland areas, karst formations or islands) that prevent or greatly restrict interpopulation gene flow. Six of these lineages were masquerading under the nomen C. intermedius and are described as the following: Cyrtodactylus auralensis sp. nov. endemic to Phnom Aural, the highest mountain in Cambodia; C. bokorensis sp. nov. endemic to the Bokor Plateau, Cambodia; C. cardamomensis sp. nov. from the main block of the Cardamom mountains; C. thylacodactylus sp. nov. endemic to Phnom Dalai the northernmost peak of the Cardamom mountains; C. laangensis sp. nov. endemic to the Phnom Laang karst formation, Cambodia; and C. septimontium sp. nov. from the Bay Nui Hills of southwest Vietnam.

In tropical Asia, Moina siamensis sp. nov. could be confused easily with M. weismanni Ishikawa, 1896, because of morphological similarities in parthenogenetic females and males of both species. The outstanding difference between these two taxa concerns the structure of the ephippium in gamogenetic females, which is highly visible under light and scanning electron microscopes. The mature ephippium of M. weismanni is strongly tuberous, with distinct borders between cells, whereas the ephippium of M. siamensis sp. nov. is significantly less tuberous, with prominent longitudinal lines in its central region. Since gamogenetic females only appear sporadically in moinid populations, distribution ranges of M. siamensis sp. nov., M. weismanni and sibling taxa must be clarified precisely using genetic markers in the future. Preliminary investigations of the ephippium structure may be useful for estimating the differences between populations, thus revealing much diversity within Moinidae.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae Latreille, 1807: Diomini Gordon, 1999), and four new species are described from Costa Rica, representing the first known occurrences of obligate phytophagous lady beetle species outside of the tribe Epilachnini Mulsant, 1846 (sens. Slipinski 2007). The new species are described, illustrated and keyed, and their life histories discussed. Each species of Moiradiomus occurs on a separate species of Piper L., 1753 (Piperaceae Giseke, 1792), where the larva constructs a small silken tent between leaf veins and inside this shelter induces the production of food bodies, which are its exclusive source of food. Background information is provided on lady beetle trophic relations and other insect/Piper symbioses. The taxonomic history of Diomus Mulsant, 1850 and related species in the tribe Diomini is reviewed and existing errors in observation, interpretation, identification, and classification are corrected in order to provide a more meaningful context for understanding the new genus. The tribe Diomini is rediagnosed and recircumscribed to include Diomus, Decadiomus Chapin, 1933, Heterodiomus Brethes, 1925, Dichaina Weise, 1923, Andrzej Slipinski, 2007, and Moiradiomus. Magnodiomus Gordon, 1999 and Erratodiomus Gordon, 1999 are removed from Diomini and transferred to Hyperaspidini Costa, 1849, subtribe Selvadiina Gordon, 1985 stat. nov. Mimoscymnus Gordon, 1994 and Planorbata Gordon, 1994, originally described in Coccidulini Mulsant, 1846 are also transfered to Hyperaspidini and placed in Mimoscymnina subtribe nov. (type genus Mimoscymnus). The main morphological characters distinguishing Diomini and Hyperaspidini are described and illustrated. A key to genera of Diomini sensu novo is provided. The identification of the Australian Diomus species illustrated in Gordon's publication on North American lady beetles is corrected from D. pumilio Weise, 1885 to D. tenebricosus (Boheman, 1859), however specimens recently collected in California do not match these genitalic illustrations and are identified as true D. pumilio. The following species of Diomus are transferred to Decadiomus as new combinations: D. balteatus (LeConte, 1878), D. floridanus (Mulsant, 1850), D. amabilis (LeConte, 1852), D. liebecki (Horn, 1895), D. myrmidon (Mulsant, 1850), D. humilis (Gordon, 1976), D. pseudotaedatus (Gordon, 1976), D. taedatus (Fall, 1901), D. bigemmeus (Horn, 1895), and D. austrinus (Gordon, 1976). Decadiomus seini Segarra, 2014 is placed as a junior synonym of D. austrinus. The following new species of Moiradiomus are described: M. clotho sp. nov., M. lachesis sp. nov., M. atopos sp. nov., M. nanita sp. nov.

We report here the discovery of a new species from Kon Tum plateau of the Truong Son (Annamite) Range of Central Vietnam, which we describe based on morphological and molecular evidence. Molecular phylogeny shows that the new taxon, G. (P.) wenlingae Hu, Cotton & Monastyrskii sp. nov., is sister to G. (P.) daiyuanae Hu, Zhang & Cotton, 2018 plus G. (P.) confucius Hu, Duan & Cotton, 2018. Molecular dating analysis further suggests that this new species diverged from its sister Glade in the Pliocene (similar to 3.5 million years ago). The new taxon constitutes the eighth and southern-most species of the mandarinus group.

This is especially true in Adenomera, where several candidate species have been recognized in a genetics-based study. Here we describe a new Amazonian species of Adenomera, which corresponds to one of the lineages previously identified as a candidate species ("sp. F"). Adenomera phonotriccus, n. sp., differs from all 18 recognized congeners by its unique advertisement call. Moreover, this species can be distinguished from nearly all congeners (except A. cotuba and A. lutzi) in having antebrachial tubercles on the undersides of its forearms. The distribution of A. phonotriccus seems to be restricted to the Araguaia-Xingu interfluve, in the eastern portion of the Brazilian state of Para. Additional sampling effort on the right margin of the Araguaia River and along the Xingu River drainage should clarify the distribution of A. phonotriccus and perhaps result in the discovery of additional undescribed species of Adenomera in a region with high biological diversity.

Part 2-Two new tree- climbing species of the genus Siphonophora, including one showing pilosity polymorphism (Diplopoda, Siphonophorida)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Siphonophorida; Siphonophoridae; Brazil; Amazonia		This is the second part of a study of a large collection of Siphonophoridae Cook, 1895 from Brazil. Here, those without an abrupt division between the head and rostrum are considered. Two species have been distinguished and are described as Siphonophora setaepromissa sp. nov. and S. tuberculata sp. nov. Siphonophora hebetunguis (Attems, 1951) from the same region has many similarities with the two new species and is redescribed from type material. Comparisons have also been made with S. .fuhrmanni Carl, 1914, and comments are made on the genera Cordillerium Verhoeff, 1941, Pterozonium Attems, 1951, Rhinosiphora Verhoeff, 1924, and Siphonophora Brandt, 1837. Finally, some suggestions for characters to look at in future collections of siphonophorids are made based on experience of this collection.

J	Sendra, A; Wagnell, C				Sendra, Alberto; Wagnell, Craig			The cave-dwelling dipluran (Diplura, Campodeidae ) on the edge of the Last Glacial Maximum in Vancouver Island caves, North America (Canada)	SUBTERRANEAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ilaplocampa wagndli; cave fauna; troglomorphic; biogeography; glaciation		A new cave-dwelling dipluran of the North American endemic genus Haplocampa is described, coming from a couple of caves excavated in a small limestone karstic area near Port Alberni, Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada). To Haplocampa belong five soil-dwelling species. L. M. Ferguson cited no less than eight more species living in soil and cave habitats in several US states but without producing any formal descriptions. Haplocampa, in spite of its large lateral crests on the unequal claws, has clear taxonomical features as a Campodeinae and is closely related with the cave-dwelling Paciflcampa and Eumesocampa genera, due to sharing similar macrosetae body distribution and absence or reduction of the lateral process. The new proposed species, Haplocampa tvagnelli Sendra, sp. n., is rather interesting for its troglomorphic features: antennae with 32 antennomeres; olfactory chemoreceptors, each a multiperforated, folded-spiral structure; and numerous gouge sensilla. In addition, it is one of the northernmost troglomorphic species to have colonised- presumably recently - an area occupied by the Late Wisconsinian North America ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, the close affinities between Haplocampa, Pacificampa (from caves in the extreme east of continental Asia and the southern Japanese Islands), Metriocampa (from the east of Asia and North America) and Eumoocampa (endemic to North America) suggest probable dispersal events over the Bering Land Bridge.

J	Calvanese, VC; Brescovit, AD				Calvanese, Victor C.; Brescovit, Antonio D.			First report of a blue hue Schendylops (Geophilomorpha, Schendylidae), with a description of a new species from Southeastern Brazil	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Chilopoda; biodiversity; Atlantic Forest	CENTIPEDES CHILOPODA	The first report of a blue colored body in schendylid specimens is presented based on a description of Schendylops turmalina sp. nov. recorded from Southeastern Brazil. The female holotype is described and illustrated, and the variations observed in male paratypes and in a juvenile male from the same locality are given. The new species is characterized by having adults with an uninterrupted series of sternal pore-fields, from the first to the penultimate leg-bearing segments, undivided on the anterior and posterior part of the body and divided into two sub-symmetrical areas in the middle region. This characteristic can also be observed in Schendylops tropicus, S. coscaroni, S. parahyhae, S. inquilinus, S. grismadoi and S. demelloi. However, in addition to the blue hue present between the first and ultimate leg-bearing segments, S. turmalina sp. nov. differs from all the aforementioned species in having the following unique characteristics: antennae less than 2.5 times the length of the cephalic plate in both male and female; posterior margin of mid-part of labrum nearstraight; forcipular tarsungulum with the internal edge serrate; tarsus 2 of the ultimate pair of legs with an apical tubercle which has two pore-like sensilla and is surrounded by two larger sensilla.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted with the inclusion of all previous and newly obtained molecular data for the family Unidentiidae Millen & Hermosillo 2012. A new species of the genus Unidentia Millen & Hermosillo 2012, U. aliciae sp. nov., is described from Thailand as part of an inventory of sea slugs at Koh Tao. All up-to-date available morphological data for the species of the genus Unidentia is for the first time summarized. Morphological differences among the different species of Unidentia are clarified showing that every species has its own distinguishable morphological traits. According to the new molecular and morphological data, the family Unidentiidae is re-confirmed as a well-supported taxon of the aeolidacean nudibranchs. The taxonomy and phylogeny of the Aeolidacea in the light of the family Unidentiidae is briefly discussed and necessity of a fine-scale and narrowly-defined taxa approach instead of a "superlumping" one is highlighted.

Rissoella elatior (Golikov, Gulbin & Sirenko, 1987), R. golikovi (Gulbin, 1979), R. japonica n. sp., and Rissoella sp. 1 were collected in different locations around the island of Hokkaido, Japan. Light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to study the general morphology of the shell and radula, and a region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was amplified for 26 specimens. Rissoella elatior is morphologically characterized by a highly asymmetrical radula with a deep notch encircled by 10-13 minute secondary cusps on the left dorsal margin of the central tooth. Rissoella golikovi is characterized by a skeneiform shell and possession of three teeth per row on the radula. Rissoella japonica n. sp. shows five teeth per row on the radula; central tooth higher than wide; lateral and marginal teeth narrow with an outer lateral projection at the base; all teeth presenting numerous small cusps on the cutting edge. Rissoella sp. 1 is distinguished from R. japonica n. sp. in having i) very short oral lobes, ii) a mantle with a large, black patch and whitish blotches inside, and iii) different color patterns associated with the visceral mass. Although Rissoella sp. 1 probably represents an undescribed species, additional specimens are needed to complete its description. This study represents a first molecular approach to the family Rissoellidae. Studies of traditional morphological characters indicated four species, the addition of COI data raised the count to eight potential species, suggesting the occurrence of cryptic species among rissoellids.

New species of Endoclita (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) and revived species status of E. kosemponis from Taiwan	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Asia; fauna; systematics; taxonomy	MOTHS	Two species of Endoclita C. &. R. Felder, 1874 from Taiwan are evaluated for their taxonomic status: Endoclita meifenga Buchsbaum & Grehan sp. n. is described as new for a unique male from the central mountains of Taiwan, and E. kosemponis (Strand, 1916), stat. rev. is elevated to species status. We show that the forewing markings and genitalic characteristics of E. meifenga sp. n. distinguish this species from all other Endoclita. The external appearance of E. kosemponis is similar to E. sinensis (Moore, 1877) but the two species show distinct differences in the male and female genitalia. Preliminary comparison of E. sinensis from Taiwan and Japan suggests they represent more than one species. A sample of the COI gene was sequenced for E. meifenga sp. n. and the primary types of E. meifenga sp. n. and E. kosemponis sp. n. are illustrated here for the first time. The taxonomic status of the non endemic Taiwanese E. davidi (Poujade, 1886) and E. sinensis needs future evaluation.

The former species belongs to the comptipennis species group in having the strongly concaved occipital margin, and is peculiar in the species group in having the combination of the interrupted occipital carina and a broadly rounded and shallow occipital medial groove. The latter species resembles P. ryukyuensis in having the occipital carina not interrupted, the anterior margin of mesoscutum in lateral view acute and veins M+Cu, r-m and Cu of hind wing not pigmented, but they can be easily distinguished by the coloration of mesosoma and the dark spots of fore wing.

Milne-Edwards, 1873 (Brachyura: Portunidae) from southern Madagascar. Xiphonectes aculeatus sp. nov. is morphologically most similar to X latibrachium (Rathbun, 1906) from Hawaii, and X paralatibrachium Crosnier, 2002, from the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia. All three species have a carapace with six anterolateral teeth, a long spine on the inner dorsal margin of the cheliped carpus, and a produced, flattened, anterior region on the third maxilliped merus. Among these species, Xiphonectes aculeatus sp. nov. is easily distinguished by the acutely produced posterodistal angle on the meri of its swimming legs, dorsal and marginal structures on its carapace, and most notably, the shape of its frontal teeth.

NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS ANURIDA (COLLEMBOLA, NEANURIDAE) FROM THE FAR EAST OF RUSSIA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL			English	Article						alpha-taxonomy; springtails; Pseudachorutinae; key; East Palaearctic		A review of the Anurida fauna of the Far East of Russia was performed, based on fresh material from forest ecosystems of Primorsky Krai. This taxon generally seems to be highly diverse and rather peculiar in the region under consideration. Seven new species of the genus are described and illustrated. Four of them, A. pallens sp. n., A. armiflera sp. n., A. multisensillata sp. n. and A. olae sp. n., belong to the weberi-group widespread in Siberia and North America. They can be distinguished by colouration, the number of ocelli, fine differences in the structure of the mouthparts and in the set of sensilla on the antennae. Anurida elegans sp. n. is a typical representative of the Beringian hammerae-group most similar to A. luciae Fjellberg 1985. Anurida longilatnellata sp. n. resembles two Asiatic blind species, viz. A. nadezhdae Babenko 1998, described from central Siberia, and A. kazulcoae Tamura 1997, known from China. The other described blind species, i.e. A. aspera sp. n., can be compared to a number of congeners, most of which are also known only from adjacent regions of the East Palaearctic. A key to the known non-cave Asiatic species of the genus is provided.	[Babenko, A. B.] Russian Acad Sci, Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Shveenkova, Yu.

Kansajsuchus extensus from the Kansai locality of the Yalovach Formation, Tadzhikistan, is confirmed as a valid taxon. Previously hypothesized goniopholidid affinities of Kansajsuchus are not supported. Our phylogenetic analyses found this taxon as a derived member of the family-level taxon Paralligatoridae. With a dorsal cranial length of 70-80 cm and a total body length reaching 5-7 m, Kansajsuchus extensus is among the largest known paralligatorids and derived neosuchians in general. The large-sized neosuchian from the Shakh Shakh locality of the Bostobe Formation, Kazakhstan, previously identified as Kansajsuchus spp., 'Turanosuchus aralensis', or Neosuchia indet. with allegedly goniopholidid affinities, is a paralligatorid closely related to K. extensus. The taxonomic composition, internal relationships and geographical distribution of Paralligatoridae are reconsidered. Paralligatoridae is an endemic clade from the Cretaceous of Asia comprising four recognized genera (Paralligator, Shamosuchus, Rugosuchus and Kansajsuchus), which is characterized by the unique suite of osteodermal features (paravertebral osteoderms with high dorsal keels restricted to posterior margins, arranged in more than two rows and lacking anterolateral processes).

A new dinosaur (Saurischia: Sauropodomorpha) from the Late Triassic of Brazil provides insights on the evolution of sauropodomorph body plan	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Candelaria Sequence; Early dinosaurs; Late Triassic; Santa Maria Formation; Sauropodomorpha	EXAERETODON-RIOGRANDENSIS ABDALA; BASAL DINOSAUR; SOFT-TISSUES; SOUTH WALES; ORIGIN; ARGENTINA; OSTEOLOGY; ANATOMY; SEQUENCE; SKULL	A new sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Late Triassic Candelaria Sequence (Santa Maria Formation), south Brazil, Bagualosaurus agudoensis gen. et sp. nov., helps to fill a morphological gap between the previously known Carnian members of the group and younger sauropodomorphs. In some aspects, the skull, lower jaw, and dental anatomy of the new taxon approaches that seen in Norian forms like Pantydraco caducus, Efraasia minor, and Plateosaurus engelhardti. On the contrary, the post-cranial skeleton is broadly reminiscent of coeval, early dinosaurs. Although not reaching the size of most Norian and younger sauropodomorphs, B. agudoensis is significantly larger than coeval forms. The new data thus suggest that modifications in skull anatomy, possibly related to more efficient herbivorous habits, appeared early in sauropodomorph evolution, along with a moderate increase in size, followed in post-Carnian times by further increase in size, accompanied by more radical changes in post-cranial anatomy.

J	Wang, M; Zhou, ZH				Wang, Min; Zhou, Zhonghe			A new confuciusornithid (Aves: Pygostylia) from the Early Cretaceous increases the morphological disparity of the Confuciusornithidae	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Confuciusornithidae; diversity; Early Cretaceous; morphospace; phylogeny	BIRD SAPEORNIS-CHAOYANGENSIS; SPECIMEN; ARCHAEOPTERYX; MELANOSOMES; CHINA; SKULL	Confuciusornithidae is the clade of Early Cretaceous birds most rich in materials and plays a central role in our understanding of the evolution of avian horny beaks and pygostyles. A handful of specimens demonstrate that this avian group is distinguishable from other basal birds by their robust, toothless upper and lower jaws, a fused scapulocoracoid and a tiny claw on the middle manual digit, among other features. Here, we report a new taxon of Confuciusornithidae, Yangavis confucii gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota, northeastern China. This new bird, however, has a normal-sized major digit claw, as in other basal birds, which was probably regained independently as Confuciusornithidae evolved, based on our phylogenetic study. Unfortunately, the biological significance of this trait is unclear owing to a lack of analogues in modern birds (manual claws are completely lost in adults). Yangavis confucii is differentiated from other confuciusornithids by its proportionally much longer forelimb. Our morphometric analysis indicates that the morphospace of Confuciusornithidae, with the addition of Y. confucii, is greatly broadened to a degree that it overlaps with the Early Cretaceous Ornithuromorpha and Enantiornithines, indicating that the biological diversity of confuciusornithids is greater than previously thought.

Horolodectidae: a new family of unusual eutherians (Mammalia: Theria) from the Palaeocene of Alberta, Canada	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Alberta; Eutheria; Ferrequitherium; Horolodectes; Mammalia; new genus; new species; Palaeocene; phylogeny	PUERCAN EARLIEST PALEOCENE; CRAZY-MOUNTAINS BASIN; SOUTH-CENTRAL ALBERTA; PLACENTAL MAMMALS; MIDDLE PALEOCENE; SOUTHWESTERN ALBERTA; NORTHEASTERN MONTANA; PASKAPOO FORMATION; HOLARCTIC ORIGIN; RADIATION	Although the magnitude of the Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction event, and the timing and tempo of the subsequent diversification of Mammalia, continue to be debated, the evidence to date unequivocally indicates that one mammalian group in particular, the Eutheria, benefitted enormously from the selective nature of the extinctions and flourished during the Palaeocene. Western Canada has long been an important region in documenting this diversification, with a fossil record that includes significant parts of the Palaeocene. I report here on the discovery of an unusual new eutherian from rocks of earliest Late Palaeocene age (earliest Tiffanian North American Land Mammal Age) in south-western Alberta. The new mammal, named Ferrequitherium sweeti gen. et sp. nov., closely resembles a second, slightly younger eutherian, Horolodectes sunae, in the major features of the molar dentition, but differs in having comparatively unspecialized premolars. The results of phylogenetic analyses under varying conditions show strong support for a close evolutionary relationship between Ferrequitherium gen. nov. and Horolodectes, and form the basis for naming a new family, the Horolodectidae fam. nov. Horolodectids first appear near the onset of chron 26r in south-western Alberta, at the beginning of the Late Palaeocene, and may have been one of several eutherian immigrants into the Alberta Basin during mammalian faunal turnover near the Early-Late Palaeocene boundary.

A phylogeny of Anthracotheriinae (Cetartiodactyla: Hippopotamoidea) and its palaeobiogeographical implications	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						cladistic analysis; Eocene; Eurasia; Oligocene; new genus; new species; taxonomic revision	EARLY MIOCENE; OLIGOCENE; MAMMALIA; ARTIODACTYLA; INSIGHTS; HISTORY; RECORD	Since its first erection almost 200 years ago, palaeontologists have assigned to the genus Anthracotherium many species, some with dubious descriptions. Although it is a key taxon for specifying the invasion of Europe by terrestrial mammals during the well-studied Grande Coupure Event at the beginning of the Oligocene, the genus has never been reviewed before. A recent interest in the relationships of anthracotheres and hippopotamids highlighted its importance for the understanding of diversity of anthracotheres. Herein, we conduct a systematic review of most European anthracotheriine species, including some Asian and American species in order to establish a more exhaustive anthracotheriine phylogeny. A cladistic analysis focusing on anthracotheriines supports us in redefining and clarifying the systematic status of most genera and species of this subfamily. Furthermore, our study results in the division of Anthracotherium into two different genera, the definition of a new taxon, Paenanthracotherium gen. nov., and the creation of a new species from previously described material, Paenanthracotherium bergeri sp. nov. Additionally, our phylogeny suggests a new palaeogeographical scenario implying several dispersal events from Asia to Europe before and during the Grande Coupure Event. This study marks the first step to a much-needed global review of anthracotheriines, including the American and Asian specimens.

We here provide a proof of principle. A new semi-slug, Microparmarion exquadratus n. sp. (Ariophantidae) was discovered during a field course in tropical biology in Borneo for citizen scientists. The new species is the first lowland representative of its genus. It differs from other (high-elevation) Microparmarion species by its size, pigmentation on head and tail, and shape of dart sac and receptaculum. As part of the course programme, the participants prepared a taxonomic description and illustrations, and used the mobile genomic laboratory of the course to obtain DNA barcodes. As far as we are aware, this is the first time a new invertebrate species has been described both morphologically and genetically from the field.

J	Grisales, D; De Carvalho, CJB				Grisales, Diana; De Carvalho, Claudio J. B.			Highland biodiversity of Fanniidae (Insecta, Diptera): fourteen new species from the Andes and Central America	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Euryomma; Fannia; highland forests; New species; Paramo	EURYOMMA STEIN; IMPACT	In the neotropics, vegetation formations at high elevations are often unique, with their own characteristic vegetation because of unique and complex evolutionary histories. The complexity of the biogeographic and ecological structure of the fauna is demonstrated by the specialized fauna and flora occurring in these regions. Fanniidae (Diptera) is one of these specialized groups that became very diversified in the highlands. Currently, of the 91 species of Fanniidae in the Neotropical region, 43 (8 Euryomma, 35 Fannia) occur exclusively in Andean and Central American highlands. Here, we increase that highland diversity by describing 14 new species from 1000-4150 m.a.s.l. in the Andes and Central America: Fannia awa sp. nov., F. bari sp. nov., F. boruca sp. nov., F. bribri sp. nov., F. huetare sp. nov., F. humahuaca sp. nov., F. kabekwa sp. nov., F. palta sp. nov., F. pollen sp. nov., F. quillacingas sp. nov., F. teribi sp. nov., F. terraba sp. nov., F. tsachilas sp. nov. and F. yukpa sp. nov. We also provide an identification key for male specimens and diagnoses and descriptions of the species, along with photographs and illustrations of the male terminalia. New records and updated distributions are also provided for the Andean species.

Life cycle, morphology of developmental stages of Metorchis ussuriensis sp. nov. (Trematoda: Opisthorchiidae), and phylogenetic relationships with other opisthorchiids	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						genetic data; life cycle; Metorchis ussuriensis sp. nov.; morphological description; Russia	CLONORCHIS-SINENSIS; FAMILIES OPISTHORCHIIDAE; MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMES; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; NUCLEAR RDNA; HETEROPHYIDAE; DNA; METACERCARIAE; VIVERRINI	The complete life cycle and developmental stages of the fluke, Metorchis ussuriensis sp. nov. (Trematoda, Platyhelminthes), are herein described. The results of the present experiments showed that, for flukes from the Primorsky Region in the Russian southern Far East, the first intermediate hosts are the snails Parafossarulus spiridonovi and Boreoelona ussuriensis, and the second intermediate hosts are freshwater fish, tadpoles, and snails. The definitive host in this experiment was Anas platyrhynchos dom. Morphometric parameters of M. ussuriensis sp. nov. demonstrate similarities with Metorchis taiwanensis, but the two species differ in the sizes of their bodies, sizes of suckers of adult worms, and sizes of cercariae, as well as respective positions of the finfold in cercariae. Phylogenetic reconstructions and genetic distances using the cox1 gene sequences support the conclusion that M. ussuriensis sp. nov. is well distinguished from all other species of the genus Metorchis, while sequences of internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) failed to separate M. ussuriensis sp. nov., Metorchis bilis, and Metorchis xanthosomus. In addition, we sequenced 1,402 bp of the 28SrRNA gene of M. ussuriensis sp. nov. being the first 28S sequences in the genus Metorchis. Comparison to other trematodes suggests that 28SrRNA could proof suitable for the differentiation of trematode species.
