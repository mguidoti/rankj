These structures are important during the mating. In the present work, we describe a new species, Malthodes gedanicus sp. nov. characterized by the last sternite elongated and apically divided into two long and flat squarish lobes with three tips of which the central is longest, and by the last tergite elongated and spatuliform apically. The phylogenetic relationships based only on the shape of the last abdominal segments remain unclear and the new species is very vaguely similar to M. trifurcatus Kiesenwetter, 1852.

The single species, P. lagamarensis sp. nov. was collected from artificial plates suspended in the sea in Parana and Sao Paulo States, Brazil. The new genus appears to be morphologically closest to the genus Janice Griffiths, 1973 from Mocambique, from which it differs in the carpochelate male gnathopod 1. Both genera are phylogenetically close to the genus Grandidierella Coutiere, 1904.

This condition, combined to several gaps on the knowledge of described species and a wide range of morphological differences within the genus, reinforces the need of its revision, since it can be an artificial group. In spite of that, a new species, Aethiopella ricardoi sp. nov., is described and illustrated. It resembles the other five Neotropical taxa of Aethiopella but is unique by the combination of fourth antennal segment with trilobed apical bulb and 7 dorsal sensilla, lack of dorsolateral S-microchaeta (ms); postantennal organ with 13-19 vesicles; mandibles with 7-8 teeth; maxillae apically hooked; and tibiotarsi I-III with 19/19/18 chaetae, respectively, with M chaeta slightly basally displaced. We also present an updated diagnosis of Aethiopella based on current knowledge of Pseudachorutinae, a table comparing all species, a key to Neotropical taxa and remarks on the genus.

SP NEMATODA; GASTROINTESTINAL HELMINTHS; SPIRURIDA RICTULARIIDAE; PARASITE; MARSUPIALIA; ARGENTINA; RODENTIA; MURIDAE	Pterygodermatites are parasitic nematodes found in mammals worldwide, except Australia. There are 38 described species, which are found parasitizing bats, rodents, marsupials, carnivores and primates. We present taxonomic notes on nematodes collected from the digestive tract of bats from the Atlantic Forest in southeast Brazil. Two species previously recorded in marsupials in this region, Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) elegans and Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) jagerskioldi, were found parasitizing molossid and vespertilionid bats, respectively. A new species Pterygodermatites (Pterygodermatites) atlanticaensis found in phyllostomid bats is here described. Despite earlier work based on females, taxonomic work on this group of nematodes is usually based on male characters, such as position and number of caudal papillae, which is a problem because males are short-lived and not easily found. Here we also describe in detail female characters, such as position of the last pair of cuticular processes relative to the posterior end. This is the first record of P. (Pterygodermatites) in South America and the first record of P. (Paucipectines) jagerskioldi in bats.

One of these species is identified as L. cf winteriana (Pfeiffer, 1842), a species originally described from Java, but considered widespread throughout the Indonesian archipelago. The two other species are newly described as L. timorensis n. sp. and L. montana n. sp., respectively. Landouria timorensis n. sp. is similar to L. winteriana, but differs by a smaller shell and details of its penial morphology. Landouria montana n. sp. is only found at higher altitudes and is readily distinguishable by its distinctive shell. A mitochondrial phylogeny reveals L. omphalostoma from Yunnan as the sister lineage of all Sunda Islands species. Based on this observation, we maintain the systematic placement of the Sunda Islands species in Landouria despite some minor differences in their genital anatomy. Furthermore, our phylogeny demonstrates that the East Asian genus Aegista Albers, 1850 is the probable sister taxon of Landouria. However, we reject the proposal by Hirano et al. ([2014] Substantial incongruence among the morphology, taxonomy, and molecular phylogeny of the land snails Aegista, Landouria, Trishoplita, and Pseudobuliminus (Pulmonata: Bradybaenidae) occurring in East Asia. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 70, 171-181) to synonymise both genera based on their markedly distinct reproductive anatomy.

All are known from fossil remains and/or from contemporary accounts and illustrations. A sixth species of rail Dryolimnas sp. nov. is described herein from fossils from Mauritius, but was not unequivocally previously reported in the contemporary literature. This paper provides an analysis of the Rallidae of the Mascarene Islands based on existing and newly discovered fossil remains, and details historical reports and accounts. Comprehensive osteological descriptions and synonymies are also included. Their ecology and extinction chronologies are interpreted from historical evidence. The relationships of Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus are unresolved, having clearly been isolated for a considerable time; the middle Miocene is the earliest their ancestors could have arrived on the Mascarenes, but this may have happened more recently. Mascarene derivatives of Fulica, Porphyrio and Dryolimnas are of much more recent origin, and appear to have originated in Africa or Madagascar. All terrestrial rails on Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues, were probable victims of cat predation following their historic introduction to the islands, whereas over-hunting by humans was probably the primary cause of extinction of 'Porphyrio caerulescens' on Reunion. The only extant rail on the Mascarenes today, the Madagascar race of Eurasian Moorhen Gallinula chloropus pyrrhorrhoa, is a recent arrival, having colonised Mauritius and Reunion after the extinction of Fulica newtonii.

Glaucomastix abaetensis is a threatened whiptail endemic to Brazilian coastal "restinga" (sandy habitats) from Bahia State to Sergipe, with a distribution limited by riverine barriers. In order to investigate the differentiation and relationships in G. abaetensis, we integrated phylogeographic analysis, Bayesian species delimitation and morphological data to detect geographical patterns and historical events responsible for its present distribution. We recovered two highly divergent clades along its range, one of them unnamed. Glaucomastix itabaianensis sp. nov. has a a yellowish green tail, 13-16 scales in the lateral flank, 22-33 scales around tail, 28-35 femoral pores and usually four supraocular scales with the smaller one disposed posteriorly. Our results retrieved the monophyly of Glaucomastix, with G. venetacauda and G. cyanurus being sister species to a clade formed by G. littoralis and G. abaetensis. Divergence between Glaucomastix abaetensis and the new species occurred roughly 2.39 Myr ago; posterior shallow genetic divergences occurred mainly in Pleistocene. Finally, we present data on the conservation of this clade of whiptail lizards.

(Crustacea: Ostracoda) from the back of loggerhead sea turtles	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Paradoxostomatidae; Caretta caretta; sea turtle epibionts; meiofauna; long-distance disperse	BARNACLES CIRRIPEDIA; PARADOXOSTOMATIDAE; HARPACTICOIDA; DIVERSITY; EPIBIONTS; THORACICA; COMMENSAL; COPEPODA	Chelonocytherois omutai gen. et sp. nov., is found on the back of female loggerhead sea turtles on the nesting beach of the Yakushima Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The present study provides the first species-level identification and description of Ostracoda as sea turtle epibionts. The new genus and species, which belongs to the family Paradoxostomatidae Brady and Norman, 1889, can clearly be distinguished from other genera by the morphology of the carapace and the appendages. Especially, the quite large sieve structure on the pore system of the carapace is characteristic to this genus. Although a similar structure is also found in the commensal ostracod genus Redekea de Vos, 1953, the new genus has distinctive mandibular and maxillular morphologies. From examination of the appendages, C. omutai gen. et sp. nov. seems to be an epibiotic species associated with sea turtles, but not a strictly commensal species. Additionally, the nearly complete 18S rRNA gene sequence is determined for C. omutai gen. et sp. nov. for future molecular phylogenetic studies. Since the sea turtles migrate across the oceans in their ontogenetic stages, they may play a role as a long-distance dispersal vector for C. omutai gen. et sp. nov.

The record of the species A. longipalpis for Montevideo is rejected and A. liodon is considered "species inquirenda". Actinopus coboi has spermathecae with an apical lobe diagonally directed; A. fernandezi is characterized by a stylized copulatory bulb and its greater number of retrolateral thorns on tibia II. Actinopus simoi can be distinguished from A. uruguayense by its carapace with a dark coloration; a reddish coloration in the palpal tibia and the shape of its spermathecae and copulatory bulb. With the presence of the Argentinian species-A. gerschiapelliarum, A. puelche and A. insignis-the number of species known in the country is increased to nine. All new species are diagnosed and illustrated; a dichotomous key to all species of Actinopus from Uruguay is also provided.

Fifty-two cave-dwelling millipedes are known for the region consisting of 38 troglobionts and 14 troglophiles. Of the troglobionts, 24 are presently considered single-cave endemics. New species described here include Hyleoglomeris rukouqu sp. nov. and Hyleoglomeris xuxiakei sp. nov. (Family Glomeridae), Hylomus yuani sp. nov. (Family Paradoxosomatidae), Eutrichodesmus jianjia sp. nov. (Family Haplodesmidae), Trichopeltis liangfengdong sp. nov. (Family Cryptodesmidae), and Glyphiulus maocun sp. nov. (Family Cambalopsidae). Our work also resulted in range expansions of Pacidesmus trifidus Golovatch & Geoffroy, 2014, Blingulus sinicus Zhang & Li, 1981 and Glyphiulus melanoporus Mauries & Nguyen Duy-Jacquemin, 1997. As with many hypogean animals in Southeast Asia, intensive human activities threaten the persistence of both cave habitats and species. We provide both assessments on the newly described species' distributions and recommendations for future research and conservation efforts.

The new taxon is unlike any other known member of the order. Conflicto antarcticus is a medium-sized (2 kg) stem anseriform. The forelimb and pectoral girdle bones suggest that it was a flying bird, and the bones of the hindlimb show that it had elongated legs. The os quadratum represents a unique combination of features; some are similar to the features of the ancestral quadrate for galloanserines and some are similar to Anseriformes, but features such as the presence of three foramina are exclusive among Neornithes. The incisura or foramen nervi suracoracoidei is absent in C. antarcticus, as in most anatids and all Galliformes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that C. antarcticus + Anatalavis oxfordi is the most basal stem Anseriformes lade. This implies that the duck-type beak must have developed at an early stage of anseriform evolution. Conflicto antarcticus represents one (and possibly the most) substantial record of a non-marine Palaeocene bird from the Southern Hemisphere and supports the hypothesis that Neognathae had already diversified in the earliest Palaeocene.

NOV. BRACHYURA; RIVER CRAB; MORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; WESTERN-CAPE; SENSU-LATO; REVEALS; POTAMOIDEA; DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENETICS; CLADOGENESIS	Recent taxonomic studies of forest habitats in South Africa have revealed the presence of three new species of freshwater crabs, suggesting that decapod diversity within the indigenous forest biome remain poorly documented. Surveys of the freshwater crabs of north eastern KwaZulu-Natal province produced a number of specimens from Ntendeka Wilderness Area (Ngome forest) and Nkandla and Ngoye forests that proved to belong to two new species following morphological and molecular analysis (mtDNA sequencing of three loci, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and COI). Two undescribed species, P. ntendekaensis sp. nov. and P. ngoyensis sp. nov. are described. The divergence time estimation of the new phylogeny for eastern and southern African freshwater crabs is discussed to illuminate biogeographic patterning and to understand factors responsible for cladogenesis.

A new species of Sunamphitoe (Amphipoda: Ampithoidae) that bores into the primary fronds of kelps in South Africa	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						herbivory; kelp canopy; marine biodiversity	CRUSTACEA-AMPHIPODA; BORING AMPHIPOD; COROPHIOIDEA; PHYLOGENY	The herbivorous amphipod Sunamphitoe roberta n. sp. is described from the canopy of kelp beds in False Bay, South Africa. The new species has unusual habits, small family groups burrowing directly into the margins of the swollen primary fronds of the kelp Ecklonia maxima (Osbeck) Papenfuss, 1940. Morphologically, the new species is best distinguished from other species of Sunamphitoe by strong rows of dorsal spines on the outer rami of uropods 1 and 2. These spine rows appear to be employed as 'drill-bits' to excavate kelp tissue and create the burrows. Damage to hosts does not appear to be fatal, but requires further investigation.

Within this range, the genus is found in the 'Ganges Delta and Plain,' 'Lower and Middle Indus,' and 'Namuda-Tapi' freshwater ecoregions. Here we describe a fourth species, A. horai sp. nov., from northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, and Mizoram) in the 'Middle Brahmaputra' and 'Ganges Delta and Plain' freshwater ecoregions. The new species possesses a unique suite of external and gonopod morphological characters, with the slender and narrowly conical terminal segment of the first male gonopod being particularly diagnostic. A key to the species of Acanthopotamon is provided.

SP COPEPODA; REDESCRIPTION; SCHISTOBRACHIA; CHONDRICHTHYES; ETMOPTERUS; CRUSTACEA; KABATA; OCEAN; UYATO	We describe male and female specimens of a species of Neoalbionella Ozdikmen, 2008 (Siphonostomatoida, Lernaeopodidae), Neoalbionella dannytangi sp. nov., infecting the skin of a gulper shark Centrophorus sp. (Centrophoridae) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Females of the new species most closely resemble those of Neoalbionella globosa (Leigh-Sharpe, 1918) but are unique among congeners by having the combination of 1) terminal endopodal segment of antenna with a reduced distal tubercle having a minute protuberance, 2) maxillule with a spinulose lateral palp and praecoxal endite, 3) maxilla with a swollen tip nearly parallel with the distal surface of the bulla, and 4) maxilliped with a sub-circular spinulose pad along the proximal myxal margin of the corpus maxillipedis. The male copepod was attached to the tip of a female's posterior process and was assigned to Neoalbionella by having a cephalosome nearly equal in length to the trunk and tapered caudal rami directed posteroventrally (swollen and directed anterodorsally in males of Lernaeopoda von Nordmann, 1832). It was distinct from those of all other congeners by having 1) an antenna terminal endopodal segment and maxillule similar to that of the female, 2) a maxilla syncoxa with an anteromedial process having seven large, conical denticles, 4) a bifid mediative process approximately as wide as the length of the shortest lobe, and 5) a caudal ramus with a unique configuration and number of setae. This is the second report of a species of Neoalbionella from the Gulf of Mexico and the third nominal species of Neoalbionella reported from gulper sharks (Centrophorus spp.). We also provide keys to females and males of Neoalbionella.

In fact, 16 out of the 117 recognized species of EPNs have been recovered and described in the subcontinent, with many more endemic species and/or strains remaining to be discovered and identified. In addition, from an applied perspective, numerous technological innovations have been accomplished in relation to their implementation in biocontrol. EPNs have been evaluated against over 170 species of agricultural and urban insects, mites, and plant-parasitic nematodes under laboratory and field conditions. While much success has been recorded, many accomplishments remain obscure, due to their publication in non-English journals, thesis dissertations, conference proceedings, and other non-readily available sources. The present review provides a brief history of EPNs in Latin America, including current findings and future perspectives.

Based on our analyses of morphological and genetic data we recognize 14 species in this genus, four of which we describe as new species (A. aridius sp. nov., A. australis sp. nov., A. higuey sp. nov., and A. hispaniolae sp. nov.), and two are resurrected from the synonymy of A. cybotes (A. doris comb. nov., A. ravifaux comb. nov.). Also, we place Anolis citrinellus Cope, 1864 in the synonymy of Ctenonotus distichus (Cope, 1861); Anolis haetianus Garman, 1887 in the synonymy of Audantia cybotes (Cope, 1863); and Anolis whitemani Williams, 1963 in the synonymy of Audantia saxatilis (Mertens, 1938). Finally, we designate a lectotype for Anolis cybotes Cope, 1863, and for Anolis riisei Reinhardt & Lutken, 1863. Our main focus is on the populations of anoles formerly referred to as Audantia cybotes which we demonstrate to be a complex of seven distinct species. For these seven species we provide a standardized description of external morphology, color descriptions in life, color photographs in life, description and illustration of hemipenis morphology (if available), distribution maps based on the specimens examined, comments on the conservation status, and natural history notes. Finally, we provide a dichotomous key for the identification of the 14 species of the genus Audantia occuring on Hispaniola.

Three species, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, A. costaricensis and A. vasorum, have attracted most attention because of their importance in human and domestic animal disease. Many of the remaining species are poorly known and the number of valid taxa is unclear. The catalogue lists all nomenclaturally available and unavailable genus-group and species-group names that have been applied to the above genera and the species included in them, indicating their current nomenclatural status and providing the rigorous nomenclatural basis for future work. The catalogue lists 14 published and nomenclaturally available genus-group names, with the above four treated as valid, the other ten being junior synonyms. There are 42 published species-group names: 36 are valid, two are junior synonyms, four are nomenclaturally unavailable. One additional species, described in Chabaudistrongylus (synonym of Angiostrongylus), is listed as incertae sedis in Angiostrongylidae. Also listed are two unpublished collection names. The catalogue provides bibliographic details for all published names, and for available names provides locations of type material, details of type localities, geographic distributions and details of type and other hosts, both definitive and intermediate, to the extent known. The catalogue is a work of nomenclature, not a revisionary taxonomic work. No new names or new combinations are proposed. The apparently new family-group synonymy of Cardionematinae with Angiostrongylidae is introduced, as are four genus-group synonymies, three with Angiostrongylus and one with Stefaskostrongylus.

Pseudopecoelus cf. vulgaris differs from Pseudopecoelus vulgaris (Manter, 1934) in terms of the egg size. This is the first record of A. koiae in the North Pacific, and the second of Pseudopecoelus cf. vulgaris. Previously, A. koiae was recorded only in North Atlantic fish. Partial sequences of 28S rDNA obtained for these two species and six other previously unsequenced representatives of the family Opecoelidae were analysed together with data from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis supports the allocation of the six clades of opecoelids - Helicometrinae, Opecoelinae, Opistholebetinae, freshwater Plagioporinae', marine Plagioporinae B' and marine Plagioporinae C', and confirms the paraphyly of the group deep-sea Plagioporinae'.

GEN.; HEXATYLINA	Anguillonema iranicum n. sp. is described and illustrated as the second species of this genus from Iran, based on morphological, morphometric and molecular characteristics. It is identified by a short, thin body, a continuous lip region, six lines on the lateral field, a short, thin stylet, a posteriorly located pharyngo-intestinal junction to excretory pore, the presence of a post-vulval uterine sac, vulval position at 89% (87.4-89.9%) of body length, an elongate conoid tail with a rounded to pointed tip and not dorsally bent, and common functional males with short spicules and lacking a bursa. Morphological differences between the new species and the three known species of the genus, namely A. amolensis, A. crenati and A. poligraphi, are discussed. Molecular phylogenetic studies of the new species using partial 18S rDNA sequence revealed that it formed a sister clade with three species of Howardula, one species of Anguillonema and one unidentified isolate. In phylogenetic analyses using partial sequences of 28S rDNA D2-D3 segment, the new species formed a clade with two isolates of Parasitylenchus. A key to identification of Anguillonema species is also presented.

The new species are distinguished from their congeners in having a unique combination of morphological, scalation, and color pattern characters, and by genetic divergence in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene. Cnemaspis tarutaoensis sp. nov. was found to be a member of the C. kumpoli group, but is distinguished from all other species in that group by having 8-9 supralabials and 8 infralabials; 4-5 pore-bearing precloacal scales, pores rounded; 17-19 paravertebral tubercles randomly arranged; 27-29 subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe; subcaudal region yellowish, with smooth scales and a single enlarged median row; black gular markings in males and females; and 17.24-22.36% uncorrected pairwise sequence divergences. Cnemaspis adangrawi sp. nov. was found to be a member of the C. siamensis group, but is distinguished from all other species in that group by having 10 supralabials and 9 infralabials; 6-8 pore-bearing precloacal scales, pores rounded and arranged in a chevron shape; 23-25 randomly arranged, separated paravertebral tubercle rows; 26-28 subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe; subcaudal scales keeled, without enlarged median row; gular region, abdomen, limbs and subcaudal region yellowish in males only; gular marking absent in males and females; and 8.30-26.38 % uncorrected pairwise sequence divergences. Cnemaspis tarutaoensis sp. nov. occurs in karst formations on Tarutao Island, while Cnemaspis adangrawi sp. nov. is found near granitic, rocky streams on Adang and Rawi islands.

Cyrtodactylus pinlaungensis sp. nov. is most closely related to a clade comprising C. linnwayensis and C. ywanganensis from the western edge of the Shan Plateau approximately 90 km to the northwest. Cyrtodactylus pinlaungensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from all members of the C. linnwayensis group by a number of statistically different morphological characters, discrete color pattern differences, and its heavy tuberculation. It also bears an uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence of 5.0-7.6% from all other species combined based on the mitochondrial gene ND2 and its flanking tRNAs. The discovery of this new species on the Shan Plateau continues to underscore the fact that this region is rapidly emerging as a herpetological diversity hot-spot for Myanmar.	[Grismer, L.

From a single locality in province Skane (S Sweden) we report the co-existence of seven species of Drapetis. One is new and described as D. abrollensis sp. nov., and four species, D. assimilis (Fallen), D. completa Kovalev, D. infitialis Collin and D. stackelbergi Kovalev, are relatively recent additions to the list of Swedish Diptera. A key to males of the 14 species of Drapetis known from NW Europe is given. Special emphasis is given to modifications of the midleg cuticle observed in males of several species that belong to the D. exilis-species group. As shown by SEM images these modifications differ greatly between the species, both at light microscopic and ultrastructural levels. These modifications are introduced as a new set of characters in the identification key. Finally, brochosomes were detected on the midleg of three SEM-examined Drapetis species, documenting indirectly that small leafhoppers are regularly used as prey.

Species are diagnosable by wing pattern and they have distinct genetic divergences in DNA barcodes, while genitalia structures are uniform and less informative. DNA barcodes of the new species are compared with those of all other Pleurotinae available in BOLD database. Each of the newly described species has a unique BIN (Barcode Index Number). Adult males and females, and their genitalia, are illustrated. Life histories of new species are unknown, but two of those were collected during daytime.

J	Alvarez-Ortega, S; Pena-Santiago, R				Alvarez-Ortega, Sergio; Pena-Santiago, Reyes			Morphology, phylogeny and taxonomy of the genus Sectonema (Nematoda, Aporcelaimidae)	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						cilia-like structures; dorylaims; LSU-rDNA; morphological pattern; nematodes; SEM	DORYLAIMIDA APORCELAIMIDAE; SP N.; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; VIETNAM NEMATODA; THORNE; HEYNS; FAM	This contribution provides new insights in the phylogeny and taxonomy of the nematode genus Sectonema with an integrative approach. A brief historical outline of the matter is presented. Then, the morphological pattern of the genus is revised and illustrated, the nature of its stomatal protruding structure, either a reduced odontostyle or a mural tooth, being its most relevant diagnostic feature. The existence of cilia- or seta-like structures in the perioral area and/or at the anterior part of cheilostom of some species is evidenced by SEM observations for the first time. Available molecular data (D2-D3 LSU-rRNA gene) are analysed, including two new sequences of S. septentrionale from Spain. The monophyly of the genus is confirmed, and two species groups with geographical projection are tentatively identified. A close relationship with Metaporcelaimus is also demonstrated as both taxa constitute a highly supported clade. A likely polyphyly of the family Aporcelaimidae is once more demonstrated. Finally, an updated taxonomy of the genus is proposed, including revised diagnosis, list of species, identification key and a compendium of their main morphometrics.

The species is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: dorsal-fin soft rays usually 10 (rarely 9 or 11); anal-fin soft rays usually 6 (rarely 5 or 7); pectoral-fin rays usually 17 (rarely 15, 16 or 18); scale rows in longitudinal series 45-57; three barbels on snout tip; pectoral-fin rays with up to two branches (maximum) throughout life; and distinct horizontal T-shaped (rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise) marking on caudal peduncle. Dendrochirus sausaulele Jordan and Seale 1906 is regarded as a junior synonym of D. zebra. A syntype of Pterois zebra from Mauritius is designated as lectotype of the species. Dendrochirus koyo sp. nov. is described on the basis of a single specimen from 143 m depth off Chichi-jima Island, Ogasawara Islands, Japan. The new species is characterized by 10 dorsal-fin soft rays, 7 anal-fin soft rays, 18 pectoral-fin rays, 51 scale rows in longitudinal series, 3 barbels on the snout tip, and a K-shaped marking on the caudal peduncle. Notes are included on the status of Pterois zebra Quoy and Gaimard 1825 and Brachypterus sensu Catala 1964.

Despite its great diversity, knowledge about its immature stages is scarce: worldwide, only 7 species (6.7%) have larvae and/or pupae described. From the Neotropics, only one species, Macrostemum ulmeri (Banks, 1913), has described larvae and pupae. The objectives of this study are to describe and illustrate a new species, Macrostemum araca sp. nov., based on adult males and females from Serra do Araca, Amazonas, Brazil, and the larvae and pupae of M. brasiliense (Fischer, 1970) from an Atlantic Forest fragment in Sao Paulo state using the metamorphotype method.

Over 50 species are currently recognized. Alloperla clarki sp. nov. is described herein from the adult male stage from a small geographic area in the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and West Virginia, USA. Diagnostic characters are presented with scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrographs. Alloperla clarki sp. nov. most closely resembles A. biserrata Nelson & Kondratieff, 1980, A. nanina Banks, 1911, and A. stipitata Surdick, 2004. These four species share similar characteristics of the male epiproct and appear to comprise a species group. The Alloperla nanina Group is formally proposed.

The combination of preserved characters allows us to assign the new species to the suborder Charadrii but its more exact systematic position remains uncertain. Morphologically, the new species is most similar to the extant Haematopus and Recurvirostra, and in terms of size to Haematopus, but it clearly differs from all extant genera of Charadrii. The current remains fill the temporal and spatial gaps in the fossil record of charadriiform birds; they constitute the first record of the Charadrii in eastern-most Europe, and add to our still insufficient knowledge of the late Miocene birds.

Lost and Found: Taxonomic revision of the speckled skink (Oligosoma infrapunctatum; Reptilia; Scincidae) species complex from New Zealand reveals a potential cryptic extinction, resurrection of two species, and description of three new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						cryptic species; morphology; taxonomy; speckled skink; Oligosoma infrapunctatum; newmani; salmo sp. nov.; auroraensis sp. nov.; albornense sp. nov.; robinsoni; Chesterfield skink	COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; GENUS; LACERTILIA; CYCLODINA; ISLANDS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; LIZARDS; ORIGIN	New Zealand has a diverse skink fauna, comprising 45 described native species, and at least 15 undescribed taxa, within the single genus Oligosoma Girard, 1857. One of the earliest described, and best known, species is the speckled skink, Oligosoma infrapunctatum (Boulenger 1887). Despite a relatively stable taxonomic history for nearly 114 years, recent molecular work has indicated that O. infrapunctatum represents a species complex, comprising numerous genetically divergent, range restricted taxa. We completed the first stage of a taxonomic revision of O. infrapunctatum, conducting a morphological re-evaluation of existing voucher material, and newly collected specimens, and generated a molecular phylogeny for the species complex. This allowed us to distinguish six species: O. infrapunctatum, two species resurrected from synonymy (O. newmani, O. robinsoni), and three new species (O. salmo sp. nov., O. albornense sp. nov. O. auroraensis sp. nov.). The name bearing type population of O. infrapunctatum has not been located again for at least 130 years: it remains to be rediscovered and may already be extinct. Two of the six species here are considered ` Nationally Critical' (O. albornense sp. nov., O. salmo sp. nov.) under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the others are Nationally Vulnerable (O. auroraensis sp. nov.) and At Risk-Relict (O. newmani, O. robinsoni). Further taxonomic work will be required to determine the taxonomy of other speckled skink genetic lineages in the South Island, particularly O. aff. infrapunctatum "cobble", O. "Hokitika", O. "Southern North Island" and O. "Westport".

The new species can be easily distinguished from most of the other species of the genus by the setation of the mandibular palp and telson and a reduced number of articles (4-6) on the accessory flagellum of the first antenna. The new species closely resembles to Q. lutzi (Shoemaker, 1933) but clearly differ by a reduced armature of the urosomites 1 and 2 and by the geographical distribution (Q. lutzi being known only in Central and South America). Ecological data and an updated key to a species in the genus Quadrivisio are provided.

The following nomenclatural acts are proposed herein: Gonyleptes pustulatus Sorensen, 1884 is transferred from Gonyleptes to Gonyleptellus; Gonyleptes cancellatus Roewer, 1917 and Progonyleptoides pustulosus Mello-Leitao, 1935, both currently under the synonymy of Gonyleptellus bimaculatus (Sorensen, 1884), are revalidated and transferred to Gonyleptellus. Stephanocranion bimaculatus Mello-Leitao, 1931, previously considered a junior synonym of Gonyleptes cancellatus Roewer, 1917, and thereby previously carried under the synonymy of Gonyleptes bimaculatus Sorensen, 1884. is here unlinked with the former but kept under the synonymy of the latter (of which it is also a junior secondary homonym). Stephanocranion serrulatum Mello-Leitao, 1940, currently under the synonymy of G. bimaculatus, is newly synonymized with P. pustulosus. Stephanocranion bufoninus Mello-Leitao, 1949 (currently combined under Gonyleptellus) is considered a junior subjective synonym of Discocyrtus crenulatus Roewer, 1913. The male of Gonyleptellus bimaculatus is described for the first time. The genus Gonyleptellus is restricted to the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Our survey of this region allowed the identification of 29 Demospongiae species in total. Two of them are new to science and here described: Biemna lutea sp. nov., and Hamigera cleistochela sp. nov.. Two species (Clathria (Clathria) microxa and Lissodendoryx (Ectyodoryx) patagonica,) are new for the region and the Chilean fjords. Lissodendoryx (Ectyodoryx) patagonica was found for the second time after the original description by Ridley & Dendy, 132 years ago. These results - considering the small number of species identified on the whole - are promising and confirm that the marine biodiversity of Chilean fjords is remarkable but not well known yet.

J	Bocek, M; Adamkova, K				Bocek, Matej; Adamkova, Kristyna			New species of Moluccan trichaline net-winged beetles, with remarks on the phylogenetic position and distribution of Schizotrichalus (Coleoptera: Lycidae: Metriorrhynchinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Coleoptera; Lycidae; new species; Moluccas; Halmahera; taxonomy; zoogeography	NEW-GUINEA; GENUS; RECONSTRUCTIONS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; REVISION; MODEL; ASIA	The Moluccan net-winged beetle fauna remains poorly studied and here, new species of Schizotrichalus Kleine, 1926 and Eniclases Waterhouse, 1879 are reported from Halmahera. Using morphological traits and cox1 mitochondrial DNA sequences, we propose two new species, Eniclases kusyi sp. nov. and Schizotrichalus halmaherensis sp. nov., and redescribe E. moluccanus Kleine, 1930. New molecular data confirm morphology-based sister relationships between Schizotrichalus and Eniclases and the analysis identifies the combined area of the present-day Halmahera and New Guinea as an ancestral area of these genera. Now, Halmahera and New Guinea are quite similar in respect of the number of trichaline genera. Concerning the size of islands and the recent origin of the nowadays northern Moluccas, these results are unexpected and thus the general validity of this distribution pattern should be confirmed with other groups of beetles.

Its distribution range covers South and Southeast Asia, extending approximately 5,000 km from India in the west to Sulawesi in the east. Despite this wide distribution range, C. rothneyi has been treated as a single taxonomic species, and no combined morphological or molecular analysis has been conducted to assess whether any intraspecific variation exists. The sequence divergences of C. rothneyi populations, mainly obtained from Southeast Asia, were investigated by analyzing 387 bp and 175 bp sequences of the 12S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COI) genes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the C. rothneyi populations were separated into three groups: group I from Thailand and Cambodia, group II from Bangladesh and Myanmar, and group III from Krakatau and Sulawesi. Groups II and III were recovered as a single clade, sister to group I. The interspecific divergences were 7.3% to 8.5% for 12S and 14.5% to 23.3% for COI between most C. rothneyi specimens and Cambodian specimens, while divergence for 12S was 3.5% between Thai and Cambodian specimens. The Thai specimens are not morphologically differentiated, and are considered conspecific to C. rothneyi. We describe the Cambodian series as a new species, Crematogaster yaharai sp. nov., based on unique antennal morphology and mesosomal sculpture patterns with molecular evidence. Crematogaster rothneyi civa Forel, 1902 is synonymized under C. rothneyi. Crematogaster rothneyi is widespread and has sister species, suggesting recent diversification within the Indochinese Peninsula.

ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES			English	Article						DNA barcode; Integrative taxonomy; Morphology; New Species; Otolithes; Otolith shape; Sciaenidae		Two species, Otolithes ruber and Otolithes cuvieri, are currently recognized in the sciaenid genus Otolithes. Recent findings suggest that Otolithes ruber likely has multiple genetically and morphologically distinct lineages and one of them, Otolithes sp. West Indian Ocean II group (WIO II group), has been previously identified in the Arabian Gulf. In this study, the specimens of Otolithes sp. collected from the western Arabian Gulf were examined using an integrative approach by combining mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene, morphological characteristics, and otolith-shape analyses. Three groups were found to have small within-group and large between-group genetic distance: the Otolithes sp. Western Arabian Gulf (WA) group, and the Otolithes sp. WIO II groups type A and type B. Accordingly, three primary species hypotheses were proposed. Evidence from conventional morphological comparisons, multivariate statistical analysis, geometric morphometric landmark analysis on morphological characteristics, and otolith shape analysis based on wavelet transformation all favor the hypothesis that the Otolithes sp. WA group is a distinct lineage. For this new species, the name Otolithes arabicus sp. nov. is proposed. A detailed description of Otolithes arabicus sp. nov. and a key to identifing species in the genus Otolithes are also provided. However, the primary species hypotheses for Otolithes sp. West Indian Ocean II group type A and type B cannot be fully supported because of partial congruence, which may result from recent divergence.

An integrative taxonomic analysis based on the mitochondrial ND2 gene, morphology, and color pattern recovered this new species, Cyrtodactylus mombergi sp. nov., as the sister taxon to an undescribed species from Miao, Arunachal Pradesh, India. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses recovered notable genetically divergent (4.7%) phylogeographic structure between northern and southern populations of C. mombergi sp. nov. across only 14 km of continuous habitat. Conversely, genetic divergence did not exceed 9.2% between C. mombergi sp. nov. and the undescribed species from Miao from across 355 km of habitat. Cyrtodactylus mombergi sp. nov. belongs to a well-supported, mitochondrial clade of 18 other species which now compose an expanded and redefined C. gansi group. Cyrtodactylus mombergi sp. nov. is only the third species of Bent-toed Gecko reported from Kachin State and indicates that additional herpetological surveys are needed in unexplored forested areas.

In addition, Lecithocera ochrometra Meyrick, 1933 is transferred to Torodora Meyrick, 1894 as T. ochrometra (Meyrick, 1933) comb. nov., Lecithocera officialis Meyrick, 1911 is excluded from Lecithocera Herrich-Schaffer, 1853, and Dragmatucha proaula (Meyrick, 1908) is newly reported from Kenya. It is revealed that the male genital figure for Homaloxestis cholopis (Meyrick, 1906) by Janse (1954) was erroneously illustrated, based on a different species which is probably undescribed. Another miss-placed figure of the genitalia by Janse (1954) was also found for Lecithocera aenicta Janse, 1954. Diagnosis, descriptions (only for the new species), depositories of types, and distribution data of all the known species are provided. Images of adults, male and/or female genitalia, and the venation of a few species are illustrated.

More than half known species of this species group were recorded exclusively from high altitude zone to the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. In our recent field survey in the Huanglong National Nature Reserve (located to the east of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) in Sichuan Province, China, we collected dozens of specimens of the H. melanderi group there. In the present study, these specimens are subjected to species delimitation based on data of not only morphology, but also DNA barcodes (nucleotide sequences of a 658-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene). The five new species thus recognized are described: Hirtodrosophila minshanensis sp. nov., H. lambda sp. nov., H. zhangae sp. nov., H. zouae sp. nov., and H. nigrispina sp. nov. In addition, an updated key to all species of the H. melanderi species group is provided.

Diplobodes thailande sp. nov. from Thailand is described. For both species we include inclined views, to permit detailed analysis of ventral regions and to aid understanding of the complex relationships between elevated and depressed zones. Diplobodes thailande sp. nov. presents previously undescribed structures on legs III, which are involved in the leg folding process. Rwandabodes kayoveae gen. nov., sp. nov. presents a series of particular characteristics, such as: elevated interlamellar process on prodorsum, composed of a triangular structure, externally delimited by a low lamellar furrow; in setae inserted on elevated interlamellar process; large free lamellar tip; notogaster lacking ridges; anterior genital furrow extends into an oblique lateral depression; depressed area anterior to anal zone; both zones clearly delimited. These characteristics permit easy differentiation from related genera.

While relationships within the clades are not well resolved, we recover many well supported subclades and a number of deeply divergent lineages within each clade. We use morphological data to describe three of these divergent lineages as new species; Hemidactylus kolliensis sp. nov., a member of the prashadi group from high elevation in the Kollimalai Massif in Tamil Nadu, Hemidactylus chikhaldaraensis sp. nov. and Hemidactylus sankariensis sp. nov., both members of the brookii group, are described from high elevation of the Satpuras in Maharashtra and low elevation of Tamil Nadu, respectively. The three new species exhibit > 15% divergence for the ND2 gene from their phylogenetic sisters and differ in a number of morphological characters from all Indian congeners. The discovery of three more endemic Hemidactylus species from rocky habitats suggests that many more remain to be discovered across India.

Cheilostome Bryozoa of the northern Persian Gulf, Iran	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Persian Gulf; Bryozoa; Cheilostomata; new species; taxonomy	MEDITERRANEAN SEA; TAXONOMY; DIVERSITY; CHECKLIST; COMPLEX; COASTS	This paper describes 15 cheilostome bryozoan species obtained from 15 sampling sites along the northern coast of the Persian Gulf in Iran. Two of the cheilostomes are described as new species: Parasmittina cryptoavicularia n. sp. and Trematooecia persica n. sp. The majority of species found in this study (67%) have a tropical to subtropical Indo-Pacific distribution, while the remainder are more widely distributed. Several are fouling species known from warmer seas around the globe. Further sampling efforts are needed to obtain a better estimate of the true bryozoan diversity in the region which is almost certainly much greater than the 15 species described in this study.

Resolving the synonymy and polyphyly of the 'Drosophila bakoue species complex' (Diptera: Drosophilidae: 'D. montium species group') with descriptions of two new species from Madagascar	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Africa; integrative taxonomy; mitogenomics; phylogenetic classification	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; EVOLUTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SUBGROUP; CLASSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY	The 'D. bakoue species complex' Rafael, 1984 ('D. montium species group' Da Lage et al., 2007) comprises seven Afrotropical species. Using complete mitochondrial genome sequences and detailed morphological analysis, we revised the phylogenetic relationships between these species including two new ones. We found the 'D. bakoue species complex' to be a junior synonym of the 'D. seguyi species complex' Lachaise, 1971 and its seven species polyphyletic. We thus classified the species into three complexes, the 'D. seguyi species complex' comprises D. seguyi Smart, 1945, D. malagassya Tsacas & Rafael, 1982, D. curta Chassagnard & Tsacas, 1997 and D. chocolata sp. nov., the new 'D. tsacasi species complex' comprises D. tsacasi Bock & Wheeler, 1972 and D. seguyiana Chassagnard & Tsacas, 1997, and the new 'D. vulcana species complex' comprises D. vulcana Graber, 1957 and D. mylenae sp. nov. Drosophila bakoue Tsacas & Lachaise, 1974 could not be assigned to any of the defined complexes. The two new species are endemic to Madagascar and we report the presence of D. seguyi and D. curta in Mayotte and Madagascar, respectively. The results hence represent a significant step towards understanding the diversity and evolution of this species group in Africa and the islands of the Western Indian Ocean.

The new species, Mollisquama mississippiensis sp. nov., is distinguished from its congener by a putative pit organ located ventrally just posterior of the lower jaw margin center, photophores irregularly distributed along many areas of the body, 16 distinct ventral-abdominal photophore aggregations, and two differences associated with the dentition. Other potential distinguishing features are 10 fewer vertebrae than Mollisquama parini and six morphometric proportional differences that exceeded +/- 20% from the holotype.

Taiwanese species of Lochmaea can be separated into two species groups based on presence or absence of hind wings. The Lochmaea lesagei group (winged) contains L. lesagei Kimoto, 1996 and L. tsoui sp. n. The L. smetanai group (wingless) contains L. smetanai Kimoto, 1996, L. thou sp. n., and L. jungehani sp. n. Members of the L. smetanai group inhabit alpine microhabitats and are the only wingless galerucines in Taiwan that occur in harsh environments, as is the case with most brachelytrous Chrysomelidae.

The number of described Antichiropus species now stands at 72. Two species (A. julianneae Car, n. sp. and A. pendiculus Car, n. sp.) lack one diagnostic feature of the genus, namely a solenomere process, but are included here because they conform to the genus definition in all other characters. We also obtained sequence data from four mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 [COI], cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 [COIII], cytochrome B [CytB], and 12S rRNA [12S]), and one nuclear gene (28S rRNA [28S]) for 19 species. Three main clades were recovered: one in the northern Pilbara, one in the southern Pilbara, and one just outside the south-western margin of the Pilbara.

The latter form a morphologically uniform group that comprises E. ussuriensis (Primorsky Krai), E. matsuae (Central Honshu) and E. nakahamai (Shikoku). These species cannot be reliably distinguished by external features; they differ mainly in the shape of the endophallic sclerites. Diagnostic characters of these species are summarized, and a new member of the E. ussuriensis species group is described, Euconnus (Cladoconnus) rudimentalis n. sp. (South Korea). Members of this group are restricted to the areas surrounding the Sea of Japan; the known distribution suggests that similar species can be expected to occur also in the northern part of the Japanese Archipelago and in North Korea.

For convenience of identification, Opsarius sensu Rainboth (1991) in Southeast Asia and India can be divided into two species groups based on the number of anal-fin rays: (1) the O. gatensis species group with more than 12 branched anal-fin rays, and (2) the O. barna species group with fewer than 11 branched anal-fin rays. The remaining species of the O. barna species group can be divided into two species subgroups by the presence or absence of barbels: (1) the O. chatricensis species subgroup without barbels, and (2) the O. barnoides species subgroup with one or two pairs of barbels. Opsarius putaoensis sp. nov. is a member of the O. chatricensis species subgroup together with O. chatricensis, O. arunachalensis, and O. barna. Opsarius putaoensis is most similar to O. chatricensis in overall appearance, including the number of vertical bars and color pattern, but it differs from O. chatricensis by the following characters: insertion of dorsal not reaching posterior end of pelvic fin base vs. reaching, vertical bars 6-7 vs. 7-8, vertical bars extending to the lateral line vs. not, branched anal-fin rays 9 vs. 10, branched pelvic-fin rays 7 vs. 8, branched pectoral-fin rays 12, rarely 11 vs. 11, circumpeduncular scales 12 vs. 14, and scale rows between dorsal-fin origin and lateral line 7-8 vs. 6. It is distinguished from all other species of the genus Opsarius by a combination of the following characters: barbels absent, dentary with parallel rows of tubercles, snout much shorter than eye diameter, mouth gape below anterior edge of orbit, body deep with depth 25.6-33.3% SL, pectoral and pelvic axial scales lobate, lateral line completely perforated with 35-38 scales, scale rows between dorsal-fin origin and lateral line 7-8, predorsal scales 15, circumpeduncular scales 12, branched dorsal-fm rays 7, branched anal-fin rays 9, branched pelvic-fin rays 7, insertion of dorsal not reaching pelvic-fin base, body with 6-7 vertical bars, extending to lateral line, and distal edge of dorsal fin black.

Here we describe Andaeschna occidentalis sp. nov., first species of the genus recorded in the Western Andes, specifically from the Tatama National Park in Colombia. Males of this species can be differentiated from the other four species in the genus by the unique shape of the distal segment of the vesica spennalis. Likcwise, females can be distinguished by their smaller and broader cerci (slightly shorter than S9) and its subquadrate point. The discovery of this beautiful species expands the range of the genus, previously known only in the Eastern Andes.

In this study, we present a revision of chiactine-bearing sponges based on morphological re-examination of type material and recently collected specimens. in addition to new molecular data for the ribosomal 18S and C-region of the 28S. We provide re-descriptions for all known chiactine-bearing species, and further describe two new species from the Antarctic (Achramorpha antarctica sp. nov. and Megapogon schiaparellii sp. nov.) and two new species and a new genus from the Nordic Seas (Achramorpha ingolfi sp. nov. and Sarsinella karasikensis gen. nov. sp. nov.). The new phylogenetic reconstruction based on ribosomal 18S and C-region of the 28S confirms previous findings about the close relationship of some members of Baerida and the family Achramorphidae of the order Leucosolenida. However, new material and the addition of molecular data from the type species of both taxa would be required to formally propose changes at (sub-)ordinal levels within the classification of Calcaronean sponges.

Spinonema gen. n. has a coarsely annulated cuticle with the inner layer ornamented with vacuoles, and lateral alae. The lateral alae are formed by raised and bent lateral sections of annules, resembling the letter C. C-shaped refers to each individual segment of ala. Some species have a dorsal spine, arched spicules and a well-developed head capsule, with a thick cuticle without annulations. Spinonema gen. n. has some features in common with certain genera of the family Desmodoridae but can be distinguished by the coarse body annuli, cuticular ornamentation (lateral alae, and in some species a dorsal spine) and the absence of subcephalic setae. The type species of the new genus, Spinonema cuticulatum gen. et sp. n., is characterized by the presence of a spiral fovea amphidialis, hook-shaped spicules in the capitulum, a velum and three ejaculatory glands. Spinonema spirale gen. et sp. n. has body annuli with the inner cuticle ornamented with vacuoles along the entire body, a multispiral fovea amphidialis with 3.15 turns and a gubernaculum intricate, with lateral crurae. Dorsal apophysis of gubernaculum wing-shaped. Spinonema absente gen. et sp. n. has a cryptospiral fovea amphidialis, short spicules, a simple gubernaculum and three precloacal setae.

Hamadiana chapadensis gen. n. and sp. n. is described based on a single male specimen collected in Central Brazil. The new species belongs to the diving beetle tribe Laccophilini but could not be assigned to any existing genera, therefore a new genus is described to accommodate it. Hamadiana gen. n. is unique among Laccophilini in having the hind margin of the metacoxal process deeply incised and medially slightly protruded backwards. In addition, it differs from other genera of the tribe by having the antennomeres simple, not expanded, the metacoxal lines not straight, and the metatibiae with two simple apical spurs. The habitus, male genitalia, and diagnostic features are illustrated, and a distribution map is provided. A recently published key to Laccophilini is modified to include the new genus.

This new species has a restricted distribution, occurring just in the upper Pindare river drainage, Mearim river basin, Brazil. It is a member of the rosy tetra clade, which is characterized mainly by the presence of a dark brown or black blotch on dorsal fin and absence of a midlateral stripe on the body. Hyphessobrycon caru sp. nov. is distinguished from the members of this clade mainly by the shape of its humeral spot, possessing few irregular inconspicuous vertically arranged chromatophores in the humeral region, or sometimes a very thin and inconspicuous humeral spot, and other characters related to teeth count, and color pattern. The phylogenetic position of the new species within the rosy tetra clade was based on molecular phylogenetic analysis using sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1. In addition, a new clade (here termed Hyphessobrycon micropterus clade) within the rosy tetra clade is proposed based on molecular data, comprising H. caru sp. nov., H. micropterus, H. piorskii, and H. simulatus, and with H. caru sp. nov. and H. piorskii recovered as sister species. Our results suggest cryptic speciation in the rosy tetra clade and, more specifically, in the H. micropterus clade. We recommend the use of integrative taxonomy for future taxonomic revisions and species descriptions when dealing with species complexes and groups containing possible cryptic species.

Here we describe a new species from high-altitude streams in central and southern Mexico. Racekiela cresciscrystae sp. nov. presents two morphotypes: thick encrusting with raised ridges or lobose outgrowths at the surface and dark green in colour, or lime-green encrustations. The new species as megascleres presents microspined oxeas from 200 to 300 mu m long, some centrotylote, or with malformations. Gemmules are spherical with a tri-layered theca, constituted by radially embedded birotules and pseudobirotules. The birotules have longer shaft than the rotule diameter, which is flat, and some slightly umbonate. Pseudobirotules of typical morphology have strongly or somewhat spined shaft. Spines can be straight or hooked. The species also presents other type of pseudobirotules, which are umbonate and with only small warts, instead of spines. DNA sequences from the nuclear ITS1-5.8-ITS2 region were sequenced from the holotype and a paratype of the new species to determine their phylogenetic relationships with other members of the family Spongillidae. Tree topologies (Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood) were consistent in showing Racekiela creciscrystae sp. nov. as a sister clade of R. montemflumina confirming its allocation in a monophyletic genus Racekiela. A comparison with all the Racekiela species described so far is also included. This paper increases the number of species of freshwater sponges in Mexico, and confirmed that Racekiela is a monophyletic genus with morphological characters very well defined.

A new lacewing species of the Chrysoperla carnea species-group from central Asia associated with conifers (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Sibling species; convergent evolution; systematics; parallel speciation; courtship song; vibration; duetting; coniferous habitat; phylogenomics	GREEN LACEWINGS; COURTSHIP SONGS; PARALLEL SPECIATION; COMMUNICATION; COLORATION; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION	Chrysoperla duellii sp. nov. is discovered, associated with coniferous vegetation, in the Kyrgyz Republic in central Asia, co-occurring with two other cryptic species of the Chrysoperla carnea-group. It is distinguished by its courtship duetting song, which exhibits a uniquely complex multi-volleyed temporal and tonal structure but is nevertheless noticeably convergent on the species-specific song of another conifer-associated member of the carnea-group, C. downesi (Smith), from North America. The song of C. duellii also shows some superficial similarity to those of European/north African C. mediterranea (Holzel) and southern Californian C. calocedrii Henry et al., both of which, like C. duellii, prefer conifers and exhibit dark-green adult body pigmentation. The new species is herein formally described as Chrysoperla duellii Henry, Taylor and Johnson and is shown to be diagnosable by song and morphology from all other known members of the Chrysoperla carnea-group. Results of restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) of C. duellii and five other carnea-group species strongly reject the hypothesis that similar songs and dark-green body colour among the four conifer-associated species are due to common ancestry, instead supporting independent, parallel acquisition of such features.

Eggs sunny-side up: A new species of Olea, an unusual oophagous sea slug (Gastropoda: Heterobranchia: Sacoglossa), from the western Atlantic	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						biogeography; integrative taxonomy; oophagy; radula; species discovery; systematics	MOLLUSCA; OPISTHOBRANCHIA; SYSTEMATICS; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; SELECTION	Nearly all of the recognized species of sea slugs in Glade Sacoglossa (about 300 taxa) are herbivorous, using a uniseriate radula in suctorial feeding. The only exceptions are a pair of monotypic genera in the ceratiform family Limapontiidae: Olea Agersborg, 1923 from the northeastern Pacific, and Calliopaea d'Orbigny, 1837 from the northeastern Atlantic coast of Europe and the Mediterranean. Both genera feed on the eggs of other heterobranchs, notably cephalaspideans, and lack cerata on the anterior dorsum. Major differences are that C. bellula d'Orbigny, 1837 has more cerata than O. hansineensis Agersborg, 1923, a more typical radula with ascending and descending rows of fully-formed teeth, and a much longer penial stylet. Here, we describe a new egg-eating sacoglossan species from the subtropical Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida, U.S.A. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from analyses of a four-gene dataset including 219 sacoglossan species indicated the new taxon (O. hensoni n. sp.) belongs to Olea. The generic placement of the new species is also supported by its highly reduced radula and comparatively short penial sty let. A full description of the reproductive, digestive, and nervous systems is also provided. Finding a new Olea species in the warm waters of the western Atlantic was surprising, given the genus was previously known only from the cold northern Pacific, and suggests further diversity in oophagous sacoglossans may await discovery.

(Mammalia, Didelphidae) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						DNA; integrative taxonomy; phylogeny; Trematoda	OLIGACANTHORHYNCHIDAE; ACANTHOCEPHALA; PHYLOGENIES	A new species of Rhopalias Stiles & Hassall, 1898 is described from the small intestine of the Common opossum, Didelphis marsupialis Linnaeus from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Rhopalias oochi sp. nov. is morphologically very similar to the type species of the genus, Rhopalias coronatus (Rudolphi, 1819) Stiles & Hassall 1898, a species widely distributed in opossums across Mexico. A molecular phylogenetic analysis using a mitochondrial gene (cox1), and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), of specimens of R. coronatus collected in several localities of Mexico revealed that those from the Yucatan Peninsula, originally recorded on morphological grounds as R. coronatus actually represented an independent genetic lineage. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses were performed for each data set independently, and for the concatenated data set (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 + cox1). All phylogenetic analyses showed that the specimens from Yucatan represented a monophyletic lineage, with high bootstrap support and Bayesian posterior probabilities. In addition, the genetic divergence estimated between R. oochi sp. nov. and two species of Rhopalias, R. coronatus, and R. macracanthus Chandler, 1932 that also occur in Mexican marsupials ranged between 7-8% and 16-17%, for cox1, and between 0.1-0.2% and 7% for the ITS region, respectively. The molecular evidence gathered in this study (reciprocal monophyly in both phylogenetic analyses, and estimated genetic divergence) suggested that the specimens found in the intestine of D. marsupialis originally reported as R. coronatus from Yucatan, actually represent a new species. Morphological evidence was found through light and scanning electron microscopy to support the species distinction based on molecular data.

J	Zhang, JH; Hutchings, P; Kupriyanova, E				Zhang, Jinghuai; Hutchings, Pat; Kupriyanova, Elena			A revision of the genus Petta Malmgren, 1866 (Annelida: Pectinariidae), with two new species from deep waters of southeastern Australia, and comments on phylogeny of the family	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Annelida; pectinariids; taxonomy; new species; phylogeny; COI; Australia	POLYCHAETA; TEREBELLIFORMIA	Petta Malmgren, 1866 is a small and poorly known genus of the annelid family Pectinariidae Quatrefages, 1866. Prior to this study, the genus comprised four species P. pusilla Malmgren, 1866 (type locality Gullmarsfjord, west coast of Sweden), P. assimilis McIntosh, 1885 (type locality between Prince Edward and Kerguelen Island, southern Indian Ocean), P. pellucida (Ehlers, 1887) (type locality Santarem Channel between Cay Sal Bank and Bahamas, Caribbean Sea) and P. tenuis Caullery, 1944 (type locality Sulu, Philippines, tropical Pacific Ocean), the two last ones were known only from the original description. We revised the genus by re-examining the types and providing updated illustrated re-descriptions of its species, except for P. assimilis of which the type material has been lost. Commonly used morphological characters of the genus are expanded to also include new ones such as the presence of pair of lateral ear-shaped lobes adjacent to dorsal base of cephalic veil, pair of ventral lappets on segment 1, pair of dorso-lateral pads on segment 5, large basal hump on branchiae, and a rounded anterior peg with a blunt tip and a longitudinal row of two major teeth on uncini. The type species P. pusilla is recognised as having four lappets on the anterior margins of cephalic veil and a large lower lip posterior to buccal cavity. Two species P. investigatoris n. sp. and P. williamsonae n. sp. are described from deep water off the coast of southeastern Australia and represent the first records of this genus in Australian waters. A phylogenetic position of one new species was assessed in the framework of a phylogeny based on a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (mtCOI). An updated taxonomic key to Pectinariidae genera and all species of Petta is given.

J	Davis, HR; Bauer, AM; Jackman, TR; Nashriq, I; Das, I				Davis, Hayden R.; Bauer, Aaron M.; Jackman, Todd R.; Nashriq, Izneil; Das, Indraneil			Uncovering karst endemism within Borneo: two new Cyrtodactylus species from Sarawak, Malaysia	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Gekkonidae; squamate; biodiversity; limestone; karst; Borneo	BENT-TOED GECKO; SQUAMATA GEKKONIDAE; KHAMMOUANE PROVINCE; PENINSULAR MALAYSIA; DIVERSITY; COMPLEX; RECORD; GRAY; NEED; DNA	The island of Borneo lies within one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. Despite this, its documented gekkonid diversity is not commensurate with other areas of Southeast Asia. The megadiverse genus Cyrtodactylus is especially underrepresented. Limestone-karst ecosystems, in particular, harbor many endemic Cyrtodactylus species, but only one karst-dwelling species is currently recognized from Borneo. This paper adds two additional karst-dwelling Cyrtodactylus species C. muluensis sp. nov. and C. limajalur sp. nov.-from Sarawak, Malaysia. Cyrtodactylus muluensis sp. nov. is endemic to Gunung Mulu and is distinguished from its congeners by having a precloacal groove, 31-38 ventral scales, a maximum SVL of at least 88 mm, enlarged subcaudals, 19-20 subdigital lamellae, and a banded dorsal body pattern. Cyrtodactylus limajalur sp. nov. is endemic to the Serian region and is distinguished from its congeners by having 33-42 ventral scales, enlarged subcaudals, a precloacal pit, a maximum SVL of at least 94 mm, 5-6 enlarged femoral scales, 19-22 subdigital lamellae, and five distinct bands on the dorsum. Both species are phylogenetically distinct and deeply divergent from all other congeners. The description of two new karst-dwelling species highlights the need to conserve karst habitats and the endemic species they harbor.

Periclimenaeus uropodialis is a closely related species, which has either been considered a synonym of I. gorgonidarum or placed as a valid species in the related genus, Periclimenaeus. During fieldwork in the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea, several species of Periclimenaeus and other sponge associated shrimps belonging to the family Palaemonidae were collected, including I. gorgonidarum and P. uropodialis. Based on a morphological and molecular comparison, it is demonstrated that both taxa are conspecific and that Isopericlimenaeus is a junior synonym of Periclimenaeus.

NOV.; WIESER	Two new species of the family Xyalidae from the Laizhou Bay of the Bohai Sea, China are described and illustrated herein. Daptonema papillifera sp. nov. is characterized by relatively small body size, L-shaped spicules with a large cephalate proximal end, triangular gubemaculum with a dorsal apophysis, 5-6 conjoint precloacal cuticularized spines and two ventral papillae located at the middle of the tail. Daptonema papillifera sp. nov. is easily distinguished from the other species in this genus by having 5-6 conjoint precloacal cuticularized spines and two ventral caudal papillae. Pseudosteineria anteramphida sp. nov. is characterized by eight groups of long subcephalic setae located posterior to amphideal fovea, curved slender spicules with cephalate proximal end and tapered distal end, tubular gubemaculum without apophysis, precloacal supplements absent, and a short precloacal seta present. In comparison with its most similar congeneric species, P. ventropapillata Tchesunov, 2000 the new species differs in having smaller body, not jointed cephalic setae, absence of precloacal supplements and absence of gubemacular apophysis.

The results suggest that south-eastern China is a highly suitable area, and Bio11 (mean temperature of the coldest quarter), Bio12 (annual precipitation) and Bio18 (precipitation of the warmest quarter) are revealed to be the main variables affecting the present distribution patterns. Among them, Bio18 is the strongest predictor with a 24.3% contribution. Furthermore, a new species from Tibet is added to the genus, Chrysoteuchia landryi sp. nov., and the male of C. curvicavus is described for the first time.

Opisthotropis haihaensis sp. nov. is characterized by a combination of the following characters: internasal not in contact with loreal; prefrontal not touching supraocular; frontal touching preocular; one preocular; one postocular; one anterior temporal; one posterior temporal; eight supralabials, fourth and fifth in contact with eye; 24 maxillary teeth; anterior pair of chin shields longer than posterior pair; 169 ventrals + 2 preventrals); 79 subcaudals, paired; 15 dorsal scale rows at neck, at midbody and before vent; body and tail scales smooth; chin shields yellow with brownish black mottling; body and tail dorsum dark with each a light spot per scale. Phylogenetically, the new species is supported as the sister taxon to "O. maculosa" from China (but separated by approximately 10% uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence) and is distantly related to O. maculosa sensu stricto from Thailand, warranting a taxonomic revision of the maculosa-like species. According to our results, O. maculosa should be delisted from the herpetofauna of Vietnam, which currently consists of nine Opisthotropis species. Five species, O. cucae, O. daovantieni, O. haihaensis, O. tamdaoensis, and O. voquyi, are endemic to the country.

Based on the four criteria used for the identification of species of Acanthobothrium, A. soniae sp. nov. is a Category 2 species (less than 15 mm in total length with less than 50 proglottids, less than 80 testes, and with the ovary asymmetrical in shape). Acanthobothrium vidali sp. nov. is a Category 6 species (more than 15 mm in total length with more than 50 proglottids, fewer than 80 testes, and the ovary is asymmetrical). The new species differ from similar species from the Pacific Ocean by total length, the number of proglottids, diameter of the accessory sucker, the length of the cirrus sac, the number of testes per proglottid and the measurements of hooks. With the recognition of A. soniae sp. nov. and A. vidali sp. nov., 42 species of Acanthobothrium have been reported from the Pacific coast of the Americas. This is the first report of species of Acanthobothrium from a member of Narcine from Mexico and it brings the number of species reported from elasmobranchs from the Pacific Coast of Mexico to 13.

The moderately diverse brachiopod fauna is from a submarine cave situated on the second barrier reef encircling this island, with three different genera being found: Thecidellina, Ospreyella and Minutella. The last genus is represented by M. cf. minuta (Cooper, 1981), which was first discovered around Madagascar. Ospreyella is represented by a new species (O. mayottensis sp. nov.) as is Thecidellina, which is represented by T. leipnitzae sp. nov. This species is markedly distinct from T. europa Logan et al.. 2015 from Europa Island in the southern Mozambique Channel (1,200 km south of Mayotte), providing an example of allopatric speciation in an isolated cryptic habitat.

J	Gao, CQ; Malipatil, MB				Gao, Cuiqing; Malipatil, M. B.			Revision of the genus Sadoletus Distant, with description of new species from China and Australia (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Heterogastridae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Lygaeoidea; new species; new record; new synonym; lectotype designation; redefinition of genus; key to species		The species of genus Sadoletus are revised based on re-examination of the type material. A total of eighteen species are recognized in this genus, including five new species: Sadoletus abathonotus sp. nov., Sadoletus alphus sp. nov., Sadoletus biprotuberans sp. nov., and Sadoletus planus sp. nov. from China, and Sadoletus variabilis sp. nov. as the first representative of the genus from Australia, described in the present contribution. The following new subjective synonymy is proposed: Sadoletus validus Distant, 1903 = Sadoletus subpellucidus Ban, 2018 syn. nov. Sadoletus valdezi as treated in Ban & Ishikawa (2013) is proved to be a misidentification, now correctly described as Sadoletus planus sp. nov.. Three species, Sadoletus validus Distant, 1903, Sadoletus voluptarius Bergroth, 1918, Sadoletus melasmus Ban, 2018 are newly recorded from China. A key to all the known species of Sadoletus is provided. The lectotypes and paralectotypes are designated for S. validus Distant, 1903, S. pallescens Distant, 1909. S. valdezi Bergroth. 1918, S. voluptarius Bergroth, 1918, S. montanellus Bergroth, 1918 and S. montivagus Bergroth, 1918. Based on external and genitalia morphology, two "species groups" have been recognized amongst the species described in this genus until now. The main group, including 14 of the 18 known species, is confirmed as the typical Sadoletus (with type-species S. validus), for which a redefinition is provided. However the generic placement of the remaining four species is unclear at present, hence are tentatively retained under the present genus Sadoletus, pending further investigation involving other related heterogastrid genera, and using both morphological and molecular data.

The GAB slope was explored as part of systematic benthic surveys to understand unexplored communities in the light of current oil and gas exploration activity in the area. Tethya irisae sp. nov. was present at 1000 m in six of eight longitudinal depth surveys. Three molecular markers were obtained: COI, 28S (D3-D5) and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2. COI and 28S phylogenetic analyses show that the new species fits clearly within the genus Tethya. This is the 28th species of Tethya reported from Australia; it is unusual in that it has a stalk. The presence of a stalk as a morphological character to split genera in this family is questioned. The description of this new species is an opportunity to revisit the molecular phylogeny of the Tethyida Morrow & Cardenas, 2015 using comprehensive datasets of COI and 28S markers. As in previous analyses, four Tethya clades were retrieved; we discuss the possibility of using external colour to support some of these clades. Despite unclear phylogenetic relationships amongst Tethyidae Gray, 1848 from Australia, our results suggest that tethyid genera Tethytimea Laubenfels, 1936, Tectitethya Sara, 1994, Laxotethya Sara & Sara, 2002, Stellitethya Sara, 1994, and Xenospongia Gray, 1858 derive from species of Tethya. We show that asters have been secondarily lost at least twice in the Hemiasterellidae Lendenfeld, 1889: in Liosina Thiele, 1899 and a potential new genus from northern Australia. We formally propose the reallocation of Liosina from Dictyonellidae van Soest, Diaz & Pomponi, 1990 to Hemiasterellidae Lendenfeld, 1889.

J	Fernandes, MR; Pimenta, AD				Fernandes, Mauricio Romulo; Pimenta, Alexandre Dias			Taxonomic review of Inella and Strobiligera (Gastropoda: Triphoridae) from Brazil	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						Triphoroidea; marine molluscs; lecithotrophic development; western Atlantic	PROSOBRANCH GASTROPODS; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; SEAMOUNT CHAIN; CAENOGASTROPODA; TRIPHOROIDEA; DISPERSAL	The triphorid genera Inella and Strobiligera are historically considered to represent one or two distinct groups, with recent studies claiming that Strobiligera comprises species with paucispiral or multispiral protoconchs, whereas only species with paucispiral protoconch occur in Inella. The present study aims to update the taxonomy of Inella and Strobiligera (with paucispiral protoconchs) from Brazil. Three main groups are recognized: Inella s.s. and Strobiligera show a simultaneous emergence of the three spiral cords of the teleoconch, the former possessing a discrete nucleus and the latter bearing a distinct globose protoconch; the "pseudo Inella" group has a late emergence of the median spiral cord of teleoconch. Four species were previously recorded from Brazil: I. unicornium, I. longissima, S. pompona and S. compsa, of which the three latter records are disregarded for being based on shells with broken apices and consequent uncertainty of identification. Twenty species in fact occur in Brazil: Inella s.s. is represented by I. apexbilirata and one possible new species; "pseudo Inella" includes "Inella" differens,"Inella" faberi, "Inella" galo sp. nov., "Inella" euconfio sp. nov., "Inella" leucocephala sp. nov., "Inella" faceta sp. nov., "Inella" maculata sp. nov., "Inella" vanilla sp. nov., and three possible new species: Strobiligera is represented by S. unicornium comb. nov., S. gaesona, S. dinea, Strobiligera campista sp. nov., Strobiligera santista sp. nov., and two possible new species. The "pseudo Inella" group is probably derived from unrelated lineages that converged to a simple type of paucispiral protoconch, requiring the examination of radular morphology to properly reallocate those species. The supposed restricted geographical range of triphorids with lecithotrophic development requires future investigations of the five species from the northwestern Atlantic/Caribbean that are herein recorded to Brazil.

J	Carvalho, FC; Pisera, A				Carvalho, Francisca C.; Pisera, Andrzej			Revision of the genus Exsuperantia Ozdikmen, 2009 (Tetractinellida: Phymaraphiniidae) with description of a new species from the Atlantic Ocean	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Porifera; lithistids demosponges; Macaronesian islands; new species	SPONGE; JMODELTEST	Phymaraphiniidae Schrammen 1924 (Porifera: Astrophorina) is a family of lithistid demosponges that has received little attention in the past decades. The systematic problems within this family have not been addressed for a long time due to the absence of new records and material. The genus Exsuperantia Ozdikmen 2009 was first described by Schmidt (1879) as Rimella to allocate the species Rimella clava, found in the Caribbean. In 1892, Topsent found what he thought to be the same species described by Schmidt in the Azores, and synonymized it with Racodiscula clava, as he thought this species belonged to the family Theonellidae Lendenfeld 1903. However, Rimella and Racodiscula belong to distinct families: Rimella to Phymaraphiniidae, and Racodiscula to Theonellidae. Due to the fact that the genus Rimella was already preoccupied by a gastropod, it was renamed as Exsuperantia. In result of the poor preservation of Schmidt's material and the absence of new specimens, the attribution of Topsent's specimens to the family level remained obscure. Here, we review the genus Exsuperantia based on the analysis of new material recently collected during various research expeditions in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. The comparison of these new specimens with Schmidt's and Topsent's type material, allowed us to assign Topsent's specimens to a new species, Exsuperantia archipelagus sp. nov., and confirm its attribution to the family Phymaraphiniidae (not Theonellidae). Phylogenetic reconstructions using newly generated sequences of the cytochrome subunit (COI) marker also support the assignment of the new species to the family Phymaraphiniidae (not Theonellidae).

A phylogenetic analysis using the ML method and MOTUs estimations by ABGD and GMYC based on COI sequences was performed. Eighteen Rhabdoblatta species were identified when these data were combined with morphological data. Six new species were established among these samples, i.e., Rh. similsinuata sp. n., Rh. densimaculata sp. n., Rh. gyroflexa sp. n., Rh. chaulformis sp. n., Rh. maculata sp. n., and Rh. ecarinata sp. n. For the first time, females including female genitalia of 14 known Rhabdoblatta species are described worldwide. Our study shows that combining molecular species delimitation methods with morphological data helps to delimit species and understand cockroach biodiversity.

This species is distinguished from all other known congeners by a combination of the following characters: relatively small body size in adult males (SVL 26.0-34.2 mm); dorsal surface yellow brown or red brown; distinctive conical asperities on dorsum; males with an external subgular vocal sac and linea masculina; throat, chest, and belly nearly immaculate; venter surface orangish with yellow spots, semi-transparent; snout rounded; supratympanic fold distinct; iris bronze; lack of white patch on temporal region; tibiotarsal projection absent; sides of body nearly smooth with no black blotch; finger webbing rudimentary; and toe webbing formula I1.5-2II1.5-2.7III. 5-3IV2.51.5V. Genetically, the new species diverges from its congeners by 2.2%-14.1% (uncorrected p-distance) and is closest to G. guangdongensis. However, the new species can morphologically be separated from G. guangdongensis by distinctive conical tubercles on dorsum (versus absent), lateral surface nearly smooth with no black blotches on ventrolateral region (versus lateral surface rough, scattered with tubercles and black blotches on ventrolateral region), snout rounded (versus triangularly pointed), iris bronze (versus iris brown), and ventral surface orangish (versus throat and chest creamy white and belly light brown).

Shrimps of the genus Periclimenes (Crustacea, Decapoda, Palaemonidae) associated with mushroom corals (Scleractinia, Fungiidae): linking DNA barcodes to morphology	CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Caridea; Fungiidae; host corals; Indo-Pacific; new species; North Sulawesi; Scleractinia; taxonomy	PONTONIINE SHRIMP; SPEC. NOV.; CARIDEA; GULF; POSITION; RECORDS; ISLAND; SNAILS; HOST	Most marine palaemonid shrimp species live in symbiosis with invertebrates of various phyla. These associations range from weak epibiosis to obligatory endosymbiosis and from restricted commensalism to semi-parasitism. On coral reefs, such symbiotic shrimps can contribute to the associated biodiversity of reef corals. Among the host taxa, mushroom corals (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Fungiidae) are known to harbour various groups of symbionts, including shrimps. Some but not all of these associated species are host-specific. Because data on the host specificity of shrimps on mushroom corals are scarce, shrimp species of the genus Periclimenes were collected from mushroom corals during fieldwork in Lembeh Strait, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using molecular (COI barcoding gene) and morphological methods, three species of Periclimenes were identified: P. diversipes, P. watamuae and a species new to science, P. subcorallum sp. nov., described herein. Their host specificity was variable, with eight, three and two fungiid host records, respectively. It is concluded that shrimp species of the genus Periclimenes show much overlap in their host choice and that particular morphological traits in the host species appear to play a more important role than phylogenetic affinities within the host group.

PLATYHELMINTHES; DUGESIA PLATYHELMINTHES; AFRICAN PLANARIANS; HYPERPLASIC OVARY; TAXONOMIC STATUS; TURBELLARIA; LAKE; GONOCEPHALA; POPULATIONS; SARDINIA	Invasions of alien species form one of the major threats to global biodiversity. Among planarian flatworms many species are known to be invasive, in several cases strongly affecting local ecosystems. Therefore, a detailed knowledge on the biology of an invasive species is of utmost importance for understanding the process of invasion, the cause of its success, and the subsequent ecological impact on native species. This paper provides new information on the biology of introduced populations of the freshwater flatworm Girardia tigrina (Girard, 1850) from Europe. This species is a native of the Nearctic Region that was accidentally introduced into Europe in the 1920s. Since then, numerous records across the European continent bear witness of the invasiveness of this species, although only a few studies focused on the biology of the introduced populations. We report on the morphology of sexualized individuals from a fissiparous Italian population, representing the second record of spontaneous sexualization of fissiparous individuals in this species. A detailed morphological account of the reproductive apparatus of these ex-fissiparous -animals is presented. Our results increased the number of morphological groups previously recognized for European populations of G. tigrina, thus corroborating the hypothesis on multiple independent introductions to this continent. Karyological results obtained from our fissiparous Italian individuals revealed a constant diploid chromosome complement of sixteen chromosomes. Further, we document the marked intraspecific variation in several morphological features of this species.

There is little information on the distribution, prevalence, and incidence of RKN available in this crop and region. Identifying RKN species and estimating these epidemiology factors in Sinaloa are important for the design of specific strategies for RKN control. A total of 278 RKN samples from Los Mochis, Culiacan, La Cruz, and Escuinapa areas of Sinaloa were collected from tomato plants at production stage under greenhouse conditions to analyze the distribution, prevalence, and incidence of RKN. All samples were subsequently identified with morphological features of females and PCR amplification with species specific-primers. RKN were found in 100% of the surveyed greenhouses of tomato, confirming their widespread distribution and prevalence in this crop along the Sinaloa state. Based on molecular methods, M. enterolobii (Me) and M. incognita (Mi) were identified in the four regions. Incidence of Me was significantly greater than that of Mi and mixed infection (Me+Mi) occurred with 74.6% having Me, 16.8% having Mi, and 8.6% with both species of positive samples from all those analyzed. This information will enable tomato producers of this region to design and implement an appropriate control strategy for these RKN species.	[Carrillo-Fasio, J.

Aenigmigulella phrix n. sp. (from Ndoto), Gulella erugo n. sp. (from Kulal), and G. runa n. sp. (from Kulal) were collected for the first time in 1997. Gulella langei n. sp. (from Nyiro) was found in 1997 but is also present in early 20th-century collections, where it appears to have been overlooked. Generic placement of A. phrix and G. erugo is supported by their genital anatomy. Tayloria urguessensis kulanensis n. subsp. (Kulal) is described, after slight but statistically significant differences in shell, radula, and genitalia characters were found between populations of T. urgessensis in Kulal, Ndoto and Nyiro. Tayloria marsabitensis (Preston, 1913) is also treated as a subspecies of T. urguessensis (Preston, 1913). All five new taxa are apparently endemic to individual mountain ranges in northern Kenya.

Zelandoperla maungatuaensis sp. n. differs from a related species, Z. denticulata, primarily by lacking full wing development. We used morphological, geographical, and genetic evidence to assess the proposed status of Z. maungatuaensis sp. n. and Z. denticulata as separate monomorphic species, as opposed to conspecific members of a polymorphic species. High genetic divergence was found between distinctly allopatric populations, supporting the status of Z. maungatuaensis sp. n. as a distinct monomorphic species.

Several epibiotic taxa are known to live on gastropod shells inhabited by hermit crabs, including some species of the zoantharian genus Epizoanthus. Although many previous taxonomic studies have focused on hermit-crab-associated Epizoanthus species, and have resulted in the description of several species, gastropod-associated species have received comparatively much less attention. At least five Epizoanthus species associated with gastropods have been formally described, but some species have not been found or examined since their original description. In Japan, specimens on the gastropod mollusk Guildfordia triumphans have been found and examined in previous studies, but no formal taxonomic conclusions were made. In this study, we formally describe Epizoanthus rinbou sp. n. from southern Japan based on molecular phylogenetic analyses combined with morphological observations. Epizoanthus rinbou sp. n. is located within an Epizoanthus clade consisting of species associated with gastropods, hermit crabs, sea urchins, and barnacles, as well as non-associated Epizoanthus species. The present study highlights the utility of molecular phylogeny for understanding the diversity and relationships of gastropod-associated Epizoanthus species.

Here, we present new molecular analyses and a comprehensive morphological revision of Nacella confirming the validity of all the currently recognized species, but with important amendments to the published distributions of several. We also show that specimens collected along two fjords in the Beagle Channel, southern South America, constitute a new taxon: Nacella yaghana sp. nov. The phylogenetic position of this new taxon in our molecular tree reveals that it represents an ancestral South American lineage of Nacella, markedly separated from the previously recognized and evolutionary recent Magellanic radiation. In addition, this new Nacella species was clearly distinguished from the rest of the species by morphological comparisons, including shell characteristics, radular-tooth shape and configuration, as well as by the coloration pattern of the mantle tentacles. This study provides new evidence about the evolutionary history of this important Southern Ocean, marine, near-shore benthic group and the role of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the biogeography of the genus.

The most frequent origins of group living are seen in the cobweb spiders (Theridiidae) that commonly build three-dimensional webs and show extensive maternal care, both putatively pre-adaptive traits to spider sociality. A very unusual behaviour was recently discovered in the theridiid genus Chikunia, where two distinct but related species occur in mixed-species colonies with potentially indiscriminate brood care. These mixed colonies consist of Chikunia nigra and a newly discovered species. Here, we describe the new species, Chikunia bilde sp. nov., and summarize the unique biology of this species pair. We also place the origin of mixed-species group living in a phylogenetic context, firmly confirming the placement of Chikunia within the clade (lost colulus clade) previously characterized as containing a concentration of independent origins of group living. The two Chikunia studied here are sister species, representing a rare case of close genetic and behavioural interspecific relationship. We conclude that the loss of aggression that accompanies group living and social behaviour in cobweb spiders might help to explain the origin of mixed-species colonies.

SP DIGENEA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; PLAGIOPORUS STAFFORD; PERCIFORMES LUTJANIDAE; HOST-SPECIFICITY; GENUS; TELEOSTEI; NEOLEBOURIA; KYPHOSIDAE; PARASITES	We report on Scorpidotrema longistipes and two new species belonging to a new genus: Holsworthotrema enboubal ichthys gen. et sp. nov. and Holsworthotrema chaoderma sp. nov. These taxa are the first representatives of the subfamily Stenakrinae included in molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Opecoelidae. They resolve among the deep-sea + freshwater Plagioporinae (s.l.) clade, but exploit shallow-water marine fishes. Based on phylogeny, ecology and morphology, we reorganize this clade into four subfamilies: the Plagioporinae (s.s.) for freshwater taxa, the Stenakrinae as currently defined with the addition of Holsworthotrema, the Bathycreadiinae subf. nov. for Bathycreadium and the Podocotylinae, a resurrected concept, for Podocotyle, Bathypodocotyle gen. nov., Buticulotrema, Halosaurotrema gen. nov., Macrourimegatrema, Neolebouria and Tellervotrema. Bathypodocotyle is proposed for species from deep-sea fishes previously assigned to Allopodocotyle, and Halosaurotrema for Gaevskajatrema halosauropsi. Two deep-sea opecoelids represented by sequence data, Neolebouria lanceolata and Podocotyloides brevis, remain inadequately accommodated. These taxa are sister to the Stenakrinae and may require another new subfamily, but it is not yet clear which morphological and/or ecological characters would distinguish such a concept. Evidently, neither belongs to its nominal genus; we propose to accommodate these taxa in Mesobathylebouria gen. nov. and Abyssopedunculus gen. nov., respectively.

A new eusuchian crocodylomorph from the Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) of Portugal reveals novel implications on the origin of Crocodylia	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Crocodylomorpha; Eusuchia; phylogeny; systematics	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; ALLODAPOSUCHUS-PRECEDENS; SOUTHERN FRANCE; EARLY PALEOGENE; MESOEUCROCODYLIA; MORPHOLOGY; DINOSAUR; REMAINS; ATOPOSAURIDAE; BIOGEOGRAPHY	The fossil record of Eusuchia extends back to the Early Cretaceous (Barremian), with the English species Hylaeochampsa vectiana being the oldest known representative of the clade so far. However, the eusuchian record from the Barremian to the Santonian is scarce and fragmentary worldwide. Here we described a new eusuchian crocodylomorph based on a partial skull and lower jaw from the Early Upper Cenomanian of the Tentugal Formation, in the Baixo Mondego region, west-central Portugal. The specimen exhibits a series of characters not seen in other taxa, allowing its assignment to a new genus and species named Portugalosuchus azenhae gen. et sp. nov. The results of a cladistic analysis place this specimen within Crocodylia, as the sister taxon to all other non-gavialoid crocodylians. Therefore, this Portuguese specimen represents the only well-documented and valid eusuchian species in the Cenomanian in Europe, and may be the oldest representative of Crocodylia known so far, helping to fill a gap in the fossil record of Eusuchia from the Barremian to the Campanian. In addition, the discovery of this new taxon sheds light on the radiation of Eusuchia and the origin of Crocodylia, which probably took place in Europe.

The new taxon has a non-basined, ultimate upper premolar with an extra labial cusp denoted as AA1(C1). It is similar to Shenshou in that it has proportionally small cheek teeth and an occlusal pattern similar to the M2/m2 pattern in multituberculates. Qishou gen. nov. differs from Shenshou in having a tricuspid upper incisor, molars with many more cusps and that the a1 cusp of the lower molars mesially aligns with the row-b cusp. The mandible of Qishou does not have a postdentary trough, consistent with an ectotympanic without an anterior limb. Another old, skeletal specimen has been determined to represent another unidentified Qishou species. A new family, Shenshouidae, is proposed, based on the type genus Shenshou, and includes Qishou. A comparison is made between shenshouids and other genera or specimens assigned to haramiyidans'. Shenshouids are more derived than Late Triassic haramiyidans' as they have fewer teeth with more complex tooth structures, but are relatively primitive among known Jurassic euharamiyidans, as they have the M2/m2 occlusal pattern of multituberculates and less-specialized tooth morphologies. Temporal and paleogeographic distributions of haramiyidans' indicate that they are a long-lasting and cosmopolitan group.

Systematics, biogeography and ancestral state of the Australian marsupial genus Antechinus (Dasyuromorphia: Dasyuridae)	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						ancestral state reconstruction; biogeographic barrier; dasyurid; mammal; semelparous	BUFF-FOOTED ANTECHINUS; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; CARNIVOROUS MARSUPIALS; BREEDING BIOLOGY; KROOMBIT TOPS; SP NOV.; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; QUEENSLAND	Since 2012 the number of recognized taxa in the Australian carnivorous marsupial genus Antechinus has increased from 10 to 15 species. The systematic relationships among these species and others in the genus are not well resolved. We undertook the first comprehensive, molecular systematic analysis of the genus, incorporating all known species and subspecies of Antechinus. Two mitochondrial (mtDNA) and four autosomal nuclear genes were sequenced. Four clades of Antechinus were consistently reconstructed in the concatenated and mtDNA analyses: (1) dusky antechinuses (A. arktos, A. swainsonii, A. vandycki and A. mimetes) and A. minimus; (2) A. godmani; (3) A. agilis, A. stuartii and A. subtropicus; (4) A. argentus, A. mysticus, A. adustus, A. flavipes, A. leo and A. bellus. The inclusion of A. adustus in clade 4 is surprising, because previous morphology-based studies suggested it was a member of clade 3. However, analysis of the nuclear dataset and multi-species coalescence analysis did not separate clades 3 and 4. Within clade 3, A. stuartii is not monophyletic and may be more appropriately classified as two species. Timing of cladogenesis is estimated for all 15 species of Antechinus, permitting us to posit an evolutionary scenario for the group. BEAST analysis dated the divergence of Antechinus from extant congeners to the Late Miocene and cladogenesis among all extant Antechinus to the Plio-Pleistocene. Wet, closed habitat was reconstructed as the most probable ancestral state for the genus Antechinus and the four main Antechinus clades. Overall, increasing aridity from the Miocene to the Pleistocene and a number of well-known biogeographic barriers to mesic species, appear to have driven speciation in Antechinus.

Molecular phylogeny and taxonomy of subgenus Eothenomys (Cricetidae: Arvicolinae: Eothenomys) with the description of four new species from Sichuan, China	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						ecological sky-island species; Eothenomys; Ermites; mitochondrial DNA; new species; unclear DNA	BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; MODELS; TREES	The systematics of the subgenus Eothenomys (Cricetidae: Arvicolinae) is controversial because of the morphological similarity among species and the incomplete sampling of taxa. Here, we gather specimens of Oriental voles from throughout their distributions. We sequence and analyse two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene segments. A principal components analysis serves to evaluate morphological variation among taxa of the subgenera Eothenomys and Ermites. Our analyses support recent revisions on the systematics of Eothenomys as follows: (1) Eothenomys melanogaster colurnus requires elevation to a valid species; (2) subgenus Eothenomys includes the species Eothenomys colurnus, E. cachinus, E. eleusis, E. fidelis, E. melanogaster, E. miletus and an unidentified taxon; (3) Eothenomys melanogaster libonotus and E. miletus confinii are junior synonyms of E. cachinus; Eothenomys melanogaster kanoi is a junior synonym of E. colurnus; and (4) one unidentified taxon of subgenus Eothenomys and three unidentified taxa of subgenus Ermites constitute new species, which we describe as Eothenomys shimianensis sp. nov., E. jinyangensis sp. nov., E. meiguensis sp. nov. and E. luojishanensis sp. nov., respectively. Our analyses indicate that the teeth of Oriental voles present extensive heteromorphosis. A species of subgenus Eothenomys from an isolated area may possess two or three tooth patterns. The three unidentified species of subgenus Ermites are ecological sky-island species whose origins are attributable to rapid adaptive evolution caused by ecosystem isolation.

Its natural habitat includes terrestrial composts and wrack beds on seashores. However, the name E. albidus is currently used for a complex of morphologically similar and closely related species. We here revise the components of the E. albidus species complex based on a sample of 100 Enchytraeus specimens from 56 sites, most of which are across Europe. These samples were DNA-barcoded for the mitochondrial COI gene. A subset of them was sequenced for the nuclear ITS2 and H3 markers. Six species were delimited with strong support by the COI and ITS2 gene trees, as well as by a multi-locus species delimitation analysis. These species are identified morphologically and described as E. albidus s. str. (with designation of a neotype); Enchytraeus moebii(Michaelsen, 1885); Enchytraeus albellus Klinth, Erseus and Rota, sp. nov., E. cf. krumbachi (ejka, 1913), E. sp. 1 (unnamed), and Enchytraeus polatdemiri Arslan and Timm, 2018. The last-mentioned species is a soda lake specialist, whereas E. albidus s. str. is both terrestrial and marine littoral; all other species occur only in seashores. The phylogeny of this group was estimated using the multi-species coalescent model. Monophyly of the E. albidus complex was recovered. Within this complex, three groups were recovered as monophyletic, but the relationship between them is unclear. One group comprises E. albidus s. str., E. albellus, and E. moebii; the second group E. cf. krumbachi and the unnamed E. sp. 1, and the third consists of only E. polatdemiri. This study serves as a framework for genetic identification of white worms used for experimental purposes.

Glandular secretions within these structures serve as nuptial gifts, and thus sexual selection may have contributed to their high species richness. However, species diversity of dwarf spiders in East Asia is yet understudied. Here, we review the erigonine genus Shaanxinus Tanasevitch, 2006, and describe 13 new species from Taiwan: S. magniclypeus sp. n. (of), S. shihchoensis sp. n. (of), S. shoukaensis sp. n. (of), S. hirticephalus sp. n. (of), S. mingchihensis sp. n. (of), S. makauyensis sp. n. (of), S. lixiangae sp. n. (of), S. curviductus sp. n. (of), S. tsou sp. n. (of), S. hehuanensis sp. n. (of), S. seediq sp. n. (of), S. meifengensis sp. n. (of), and S. atayal sp. n. (of). In addition, one new species from Vietnam, S. tamdaoensis sp. n. (o), is described from museum material. We reconstructed the dimension of glandular tissues associated with male prosoma modifications in Shaanxinus, as well as the detailed palpal structure by micro-computer tomography. Placement within Shaanxinus and intrageneric relationships were inferred by means of a cladistic analysis based on morphological characters. Sequences of COI, 16S, and 28S genetic markers corroborated the monophyly of some species, as well as male-female matching. Poly-/paraphyly of morphologically delimitated species in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) trees led to the discovery of two seemingly identical species, for which diagnostic morphological features could then be further identified. We discuss incomplete lineage sorting and introgression as possible causes of mtDNA poly-/paraphyly in morphologically indistinguishable specimens.

On the basis of new fossil data and phylogenetic analyses, this froghopper family is herein chosen as a case study to discuss the potential influence of the absence and/or neglect of body information in palaeoentomological studies. Mesodorus orientalis Chen et Wang, gen. et sp. nov., found in the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, bears a venational topology of fore- and hindwings similar to that of the genus Fangyuania from the same horizon and locality, but distinctly differs from the latter and other known sinoalids in possessing a series of unique body characters. Given the similar wing features, Jiania crebra and J. gracila were proposed to be synonyms in a recent study; these two congeners, however, are apparently discernable in their ovipositor and so the synonym should be rejected. Three main clades were recovered within the Sinoalidae in our cladistic analyses, including Clade I (Stictocercopis + Chengdecercopis), Clade II (Huabeicercopis + Luanpingia + Sinoala + Jiania + Shufania), and Clade III (Fangyuania + Mesodorus), and their relationship is as following: Clade I + (Clade II+Clade III). The Jurassic Clade I, as the basal lineage, is remarkably different from other sinoalids in bearing wings with complex venation, but similar to the Jurassic Clade II in body structures. The Cretaceous Clade III possesses a reduced wing topology similar to Clade II, but differs from the latter in possessing a series of novel body characteristics for each taxon (i.e., Fangyuania and Mesodorus). Unsurprisingly, our finds confirm that the information from body structures, vital to understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of extinct insects, should not be ignored in palaeoentomological studies.

A radiation of a dozen species on sky islands across peninsular India (Squamata: Gekkonidae, Hemiphyllodactylus) with the description of three new species	ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION			English	Article						Biogeography; Divergence dating; Eastern Ghats; Systematics; Western Ghats	SOUTHERN EASTERN GHATS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CYRTODACTYLUS SQUAMATA; SAURIA GEKKONIDAE; MOUNTAIN PASSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BLEEKER; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGENY; PATTERNS	Sky Islands are high-elevation environments that are separated by warmer, low elevations, forming natural patches of unique montane habitat that often persist through changing climates. Peninsular India was ancestrally forested and has gradually become more arid since at least the Oligocene, and open landscapes have dominated since the middle-late Miocene. Mesic forests today are largely restricted to coastal mountains and some other montane habitats. A mitochondrial phylogeny and fossil-calibrated timetree of Indian Hemiphyllodactylus reveal an Indochinese origin and an endemic radiation with 12 species-level lineages, where a single species was known, that diversified in the Oligocene-Miocene across montane forest habitats in the Eastern Ghats and south India. The phylogeny also suggests the discontinuous Eastern Ghats mountain range encompasses two distinct biogeographic entities: north and south of the Pennar/Krishna-Godavari River basins. This studyhighlights the deep history of the region and the importance of montane habitats as islands of unique biodiversity that have persisted through millions of years of changing climates. We describe three new species: Hemiphyllodactylus arakuensis sp. nov., H. jnana sp. nov. and H. kolliensis sp. nov. from montane habitats above 1000m. The montane habitats of these species are emerging hotspots of reptile endemism, and this study emphasizes the need for systematic biodiversity inventory across India to uncover basic patterns of diversity and distribution.

(Physalopteridae), is described from the stomach and intestine of the freshwater fish Monopterus cuchia (Hamilton) (Synbranchidae) in Bijnor district, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is mainly characterized by the lengths of spicules (468 - 510 mu m and 186 - 225 mu m), the postequatorial vulva without elevated lips, the presence of pseudolabial lateroterminal depressions and by the number and arrangement of caudal papillae. This is the first representative of the genus reported from a synbranchiform fish. Another new congeneric species, Heliconema pisodonophidis n. sp. is established based on a re-examination of nematodes previously reported as H. longissimum (Ortlepp, 1922) from Pisodonophis boro (Hamilton) (Ophichthidae) in Thailand; ovoviviparity in this species is a unique feature among all physalopterids. Heliconema hamiltonii Bilqees et Khanum, 1970 is designated as a species dubia and the nematodes previously reported as H. longissimum from Mastacembelus armatus (Lacepede) in India are considered to belong to H. kherai Gupta et Duggal, 1989.

Corvospongilla lemuriensis sp. n. diverges from all the other known species of the genus in its unique combination of diagnostic morphotraits (a) sessile gemmules with chambered pneumatic layer within tri-layered theca and enveloped by spicular cage of dominant acanthostrongyles, (b) dominant acanthostrongyles and less frequent acanthoxeas-strongyloxeas as megascleres and gemmuloscleres. The new species is characterised by the exclusive presence of a well-developed pneumatic layer in sessile gemmules not described for the genus until now. The new record confirms a Gondwanian track for the genus Corvospongilla and increases the knowledge on Spongillida historical biogeography. In synthesis the present discovery of Corvospongilla in the Malagasy biogeographic province (a) contributes to the assessment of Afrotropical biodiversity, (b) enlarges the geographic range of the genus reducing its disjunct distribution, and (c) focus on the evolutionary history of adaptive morphofunctional traits of resting bodies and life cycle timing in ephemeral water of the south-eastern Austral hemisphere.

Deutella mazatlanensis was found associated with blyozoans, hydroids and sponges in shallow waters. The new species can be differentiated from the remaining species of the genus mainly by the dorsal, anteriorly directed projection on the head; the two dorsal projections and a lateral acute projection anteroventrally projected on pereonite 2 and gnathopod 2 in males. The presence of this species on the Mexican Pacific coast, constitutes the fourth report of Deutella genus for the Pacific Ocean and the first record from the tropical Eastern Pacific.

The new species, A. mcedwardi n. sp., is small, with a maximum major radius < 30 mm. Specimens of A. mcedwardi n. sp. have been found in five museums as an undescribed species or misidentified under several names. The spination of the oral surface most closely resembles that of Astropecten antillensis Liitken, 1859 from the Caribbean, but the body form is similar to that of Astropecten duplicatus Gray, 1840, which is found in the same geographic range. Examination of specimens from different collections indicates that the new species may overlap in distribution withA. antillensis along the East Florida Shelf. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial genes reveal that A. mcedwardi is closely related to A. antillensis but that its phylogenetic lineage is distinct from that of A. antillensis.

ZOOTAXA			English	Article						COI sequences; new species; revived name; collection records		Taxonomic status of the widely spread xiphydriid woodwasp Xiphydria camelus (Linne, 1758) was revised by examining morphology of 964 specimens and by molecular analysis using COI barcode sequences. Both morphological and molecular approaches indicated existence of three separate species masquerading in X. camelus of authors in East Asia. The three species were finally determined as X. camelus, X. eborata Konow, 1899, and a new species, X. albopicta. Xiphydria eborata is revived from synonymy with X. camelus and X. albopicta is described as a new species from Russia (Primorskij Kraj), China (Heilongjiang) and Japan (Hokkaido).

J	Kraus, F				Kraus, Fred			A revision of Callulops doriae (Anura: Microhylidae), with descriptions of four new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Callulops argus sp. nov.; Callulops bicolor sp. nov.; Callulops stellatus sp. nov.; Callulops taxispilotus sp. nov.; Manthophryne neuhausii; Papua New Guinea; sibling species complex	AMPHIBIA; FROGS	I investigate the taxonomy of frogs currently assigned to the single species Callulops doriae, which is unique in the genus for its warty, dark-spotted dorsum and large yellow or orange blotches in the groin and on the hidden surfaces of the thighs. I show that many species are currently encompassed under this single name, I remove Manthophryne neuhaussi from synonymy, and I describe four new species, three of which have long been in museum collections, and one of which is newly collected by me. Each of these new species is most readily distinguished by their unique color patterns, but additional morphological features-primarily morphometric-also serve to distinguish among them. Despite this partition of C. doriae, additional museum specimens cannot be assigned to any of the species treated here and certainly represent unrecognized species. But the poor states of preservation of some of these and the absence of color-pattern information in life preclude describing them until new material of each is available. Three of the six species treated herein, which occur in the southern portion of the Papuan Peninsula, were previously included in a molecular phylogeny, and inferred dates of divergence for them accord well with the geological dynamism of this region created by opening of the Woodlark Rift. In two cases, pairs of species are reported in general sympatry, and elevational data suggest that these species are likely to segregate elevationally where their ranges approach each other. At least four of the species treated herein are known to produce viscous glandular secretions that presumably deter predators, and I describe the defensive display of one of these, which I presume is aposematic.

This genus has been shown to be sister to the remainder of Mimallonidae, and therefore has been placed in its own monogeneric subfamily, Zaphantinae St Laurent and Kawahara. Long considered monotypic or bitypic, Zaphanta have not been the focus of any systematic treatment. The moths belonging to this genus are found throughout Central and South America, and detailed examination of several disparate, as well as sympatric, populations of Zaphanta have revealed numerous undescribed species all of similar appearance, but with distinct male genitalia, which we describe here. We redescribe Z. infantilis Dyar and Z. fraterna Schaus, and describe the females of both for the first time. An additional nine new species are described and figured from the Amazon, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest: Z. acuta sp. nov., Z. anas sp. nov., Z. bahiana sp. nov., Z. beckeri sp. nov., Z. elephanta sp. nov., Z. elephanticula sp. nov., Z. machaera sp. nov., Z. rawlinsi sp. nov. and Z. stiletto sp. nov.

Thirteen species were identified, including three additional records of previously recorded species of Amphictene and two new species, A. cercusa n. sp. and A. undulata n. sp., two species of the genus Lagis which has not previously been recorded from Australia, including a new species, L. portus n. sp., and five additional records of previously recorded species of Pectinaria and one new species, P ningalooensis n. sp. The study revealed additional characters which are useful to identify species of pectinariids, a pair of ear-shaped lobes which are adjacent to both sides of dorsal base of cephalic veil in species of Pectinaria and Amphictene, but in Lagis they are present between the buccal cavity and lateral margin of segment 1; and a pair of ventral lappets which have not previously been described on the lateral margin of segment I in all species of pectinariids from Australia. For species where numerous individuals were available for study, we investigated how some characters, change with increasing body size. A key to all recorded species from Australia is given, but does not imply any phylogenetic relationships.

The present paper lists and diagnoses 19 species belonging to the vetigastropod families Calliostomatidae, Colloniidae, Margaritidae, and Solariellidae. A new species, Calliostoma valkuri sp. nov., is described. It is mainly characterized by a very short teleoconch I, with limits marked by conspicuous varices and sculpture consisting of 3 spiral threads; sculpture of the teleoconch II consisting of spiral cords with thorn-like projections; and the presence of two strongly marked cords on the median portion of the whorls. Based on the MD55 samples and complementary specimens from other expeditions, the following species have their geographical and/or bathymetrical range extended: Bathymophila euspira, Calliostoma gemmosum, Calliostoma rude, Callogaza watsoni, Gaza compta, Falsimargarita terespira, Homalopoma boffii, Lamellitrochus cancapae comb. nov., Lamellitrochus pourtalesi, Margarites imperialis, and Solariella quinni.

Two new species of treefrog (Pelodrydidae: Litoria) from southern New Guinea elucidated by DNA barcoding	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Frog diversity; genetic diversity; Papua New Guinea; parachuting; rostral projection; species complex	ANURA MICROHYLIDAE; CHOEROPHRYNE ANURA; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; PAPUA; HYLIDAE; SYSTEMATICS; AMPHIBIANS; FROGS	New Guinea is home to the world's most diverse insular frog biota, but only a small number of taxa have been included in genetically informed assessments of species diversity. Here we describe two new species of New Guinea treefrog in the genus Litoria that were first flagged during assessments of genetic diversity (DNA barcoding) and are currently only known from the holotypes. Litoria pterodactyla sp. nov. is a large green species in the Litoria graminea species complex from hill forests in Western Province, Papua New Guinea and is the third member of this group known from south of the Central Cordillera. Litoria vivissimia sp. nov. is a small, spike-nosed species from mid-montane forests on the Central Cordillera. It is morphologically very similar to Litoria pronimia, but occurs nearly 1000 m higher than any known locality for that species. More extensive genetically informed assessment of diversity in New Guinea frogs seems certain to reveal many more as-yet-unrecognised taxa in complexes of morphologically similar species.

An emerging consensus in the evolution, phylogeny, and systematics of marsupials and their fossil relatives (Metatheria)	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY			English	Article						evolution; fossils; Marsupialia; Metatheria; phylogeny; systematics	WORLD HERITAGE AREA; OPOSSUM PAUCITUBERCULATA CAENOLESTIDAE; SOUTH-AMERICAN METATHERIANS; EOCENE-OLIGOCENE TRANSITION; MIDDLE MIOCENE; NORTHWESTERN QUEENSLAND; SP NOV.; EARLY PALEOCENE; BANDICOOT MARSUPIALIA; DIDELPHID MARSUPIALS	Marsupials and their fossil relatives, which collectively comprise Metatheria, have been of scientific interest for centuries, with many aspects of their evolution and systematics subject to intense research and debate. Here, we review progress over the last 25 years, which has included the description of many new species (modern and fossil), and major improvements in understanding of their phylogenetic relationships, as well as the overall evolutionary history and biogeography of Marsupialia (crown-clade) and Metatheria (total-clade). Significant advances have included the deployment of increasingly sophisticated molecular, morphological, and total evidence analyses, which have resolved most previously disputed relationships among and within the modern marsupial orders. A broad systematic consensus is now emerging, although several major areas of contention remain, particularly among fossil metatherians. New modern species continue to be described at an impressive rate, with almost 50 named in the last 25 years, and many more await discovery. There has also been an explosion in the discovery and description of fossil marsupials and non-marsupial metatherians (similar to 270 species), principally from Australasia and the Americas but also from Antarctica, Europe, and Asia. Most are represented by dental specimens only, but some consist of complete and well-preserved material, which has led to major improvements in our understanding of the evolution of cranial and postcranial morphology. Improvements in the fossil record and advances in methods for inferring divergence times have helped clarify when and where key events occurred in metatherian evolution, and the patterns of subclade diversification. We also have improved understanding of biogeographical relationships among metatherians on different landmasses. Despite enormous progress, numerous key uncertainties remain due to major gaps in the fossil record (e.g., Antarctica, Late Cretaceous, and early Paleogene of Australia) and a comparative lack of studies that directly combine molecular and fossil data. Future advances will largely depend on improvements in the fossil record and studies that better integrate neontological and paleontological evidence.	[Eldridge, Mark D.

It differs from all other Tomopterna species by advertisement call, 16S rRNA sequence and consistent differences in adult morphology. The tadpole is similar to that of Tomopterna cryptotis. Haplotype networks of 16S and the nuclear tyr gene show that it is distinct from T. delalandii, with which it has been confused. A phylogeny of the genus, excluding the little-known T. monticola, shows that the new species is basal to a Glade that includes T. delalandii and six other species. We extend the known range of T. damarensis to southern Namibia. and correct the identification of some GenBank material.

In addition, evidenced by the phylogenetic analyses in this study and literature data, we suggest that A. liangshanensis should be synonymized withA. loloensis and the records of A. marmoratus in Yunnan, China should be referred to A. afghanus. Following our proposal, the genus Amolops contains 57 species, with 32 recorded from China.

It is a member of the Lygodactylus picturatus group and is distinguished from other closely related species by its small size (maximum 35 mm SVL), five postpostmental scales, seven precloacal pores, and a distinctive color pattern. A pale Y-shaped mark on the crown continues along the vertebral midline to the tail base and is flanked by a pair of dark stripes. In addition to its morphological differences, the new species is genetically divergent from its most closely related congeners. L. keniensis and L. wojnowskii. The new species is widespread in the southern and southeastern arid lands within the Tsavo Conservation Area, mainly in Taita-Taveta, Kitui, Makueni, Kajiado, Kilifi, Kwale and Tana River Counties. It is chiefly associated with bushland with short trees, including areas of anthropogenic influence.

A new skink of the genus Subdoluseps (Hardwicke & Gray, 1828) from Peninsular Malaysia	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Integrative taxonomy; Thai-Malay Peninsula; Borneo; Lygosoma. Scincidae	REPTILIA SQUAMATA SCINCIDAE; SUPPLE SKINK; INDO-CHINA; PHYLOGENY; BORNEO; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; INFERENCE	An integrative taxonomic analysis of Subdoluseps herberti from southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia and S. samajaya from Sarawak, East Malaysia (Borneo) recovers the former as paraphyletic with respect to the latter. The analyses recover the three southernmost populations of S. herberti in Peninsular Malaysia as conspecific and the sister lineage of S. samajaya, whereas S. herberti from Thailand and northern Peninsular Malaysia constitute the sister species to S. samajaya plus the southern three Peninsular Malaysian populations. As such, the southern populations are described herein as S. malayana sp. nov. and all three species are referred to as the S. herberti group. Clade boundaries and breaks within this group on the Thai-Malay Peninsula occurring at the Isthmus of Kra, across the Kangar-Pattani line, and between the Thai-Malay Peninsula and Borneo are consistent with phylogeographic patterns of other Sundaic taxa. The discovery of S. malayana sp. nov. continues to underscore the fact that, despite the well-studied nature of the lizard fauna of Peninsular Malaysia, much of it still remains unrealized and for conservation efforts to move forward, field research followed by expeditiously revised taxonomies must continue.

(Echinodermata, Ophiuroidea, Ophiacanthida), from Jeju Island, Korea	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES			English	Article						Taxonomy; Phylogeny; Brittle stars; Ophiacanthidae; Mitochondrial COI	REPRODUCTION; PHYLOGENY; CLARK	A new species of Ophiuroidea, Ophiacantha scissionis sp. nov., is described. It was collected from Munseom Island, Jeju-do, South Korea at a depth of 28-36 m, by SCUBA diving. Ophiacantha scissionis has unique and distinct morphological characteristics: small disk, densely covered by small trifid spines, radial shields completely concealed by disk spines, six arms with four arm spines proximally, fissiparous. In addition, this species is clearly distinguished from other species of Ophiacantha by mitochondrial COI. This species is usually hexamerous and reproduces asexually by fissiparity. It is the first report of fissiparous reproduction in the genus Ophiacantha.

There are a number of unnamed lineages that are >5% divergent on ND2 across the phylogeny, including three from the gracilis clade on an elevation gradient (800-1400 m asl.) around Yercaud in the Shevaroy massif, Salem district, Tamil Nadu. We describe two of these as new species-Cnemaspis shevaroyensis sp. nov. and Cnemaspis thackerayi sp. nov. are both allied to Cnemaspis gracilis and can be diagnosed from all other Indian Cnemaspis by the absence of spine-like scales on flank, heterogeneous dorsal pholidosis, presence of femoral and precloacal pores, tail with enlarged, strongly keeled, conical tubercles forming whorls, a median row of enlarged and smooth sub-caudals. They differ from C. gracilis and each other in body size, the number of tubercles around midbody, the number of tubercles in paravertebral rows, the number of femoral and precloacal pores, the number of poreless scales in-between precloacal pores and between femoral and precloacal pores, and subtle colour pattern differences; besides uncorrected mitochondrial sequence divergence (7.9-16.6 %). We also provide a description of Cnemaspis yercaudensis from its type locality and an additional locality. The discovery of two endemic species and a third unnamed divergent lineage from an isolated massif in peninsular India outside the Western Ghats indicate that many other such understudied hill ranges may harbour high endemic biodiversity.

The host range of these wasps is usually species-specific, although in some less common associations more than one wasp species interacts with the same host spider. Here we describe and illustrate the polysphinctine wasps Zatypota baezae sp. n. and Zatypota mulunguensis sp. n. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), both koinobiont ectoparasitoids of the spider Anelosimus baeza (Theridiidae). The two parasitoid wasps show the same development time (12 days) which was longer when compared with other parasitoid wasps Z. anomala Holmgren and Z. riverai Gauld (nine days). As described for other species of Zatypota and Hymenoepimecis, the second larval instar remains attached to the spider by the remains of the chorion and also by a rigid brownish-semitransparent membrane called a saddle.

J	Nurinsiyah, AS; Neiber, MT; Hausdorf, B				Nurinsiyah, Ayu Savitri; Neiber, Marco T.; Hausdorf, Bernhard			Revision of the land snail genus Landouria Godwin-Austen, 1918 (Gastropoda, Camaenidae) from Java	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Camaenidae; Indonesia; Java; Landouria; phylogeny	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; PULMONATA; HYGROMIIDAE; RADIATION; ISLANDS; STYLOMMATOPHORA; MORPHOLOGY; MANDARINA; INFERENCE; ANATOMY	A revision of the land snail genus Landouria Godwin-Austin, 1918 (Camaenidae) from Java reveals that this group represents the most diverse land snail radiation on that island. Only six species of Landouria were recognized from Java in the last revision of the genus based on shell characters. Our investigation, which also considers the genitalia as well as DNA sequences, shows that the diversity in Java is much higher. Based on newly collected specimens as well as museum material, twenty-eight species of Landouria from Java are described and figured. To stabilize the nomenclature, neotypes are designated for L. winteriana (Pfeiffer, 1842) and L. rotatoria (Pfeiffer, 1842). Sixteen species are described as new to science, i.e., L. naggsi sp. nov., L. parahyangensis sp. nov., L. nusakambangensis sp. nov., L. petrukensis sp. nov., L. tholiformis sp. nov., L. madurensis sp. nov., L. abdidalem sp. nov., L. sewuensis sp. nov., L. tonywhitteni sp. nov., L. sukoliloensis sp. nov., L. nodifera sp. nov., L. pacitanensis sp. nov., L. zonifera sp. nov., L. pakidulan sp. nov., L. dharmai sp. nov. and L. menorehensis sp. nov. Landouria conoidea (Leschke, 1914) comb. nov., L. intumescens (Martens, 1867) comb. nov., L. moussoniana (Martens, 1867) comb. nov., L. schepmani (Mollendorff, 1897) comb. nov. and L. leucochila (Gude, 1905) comb. nov. are considered valid species of the genus Landouria for the first time. Plectotropis kraepelini Leschke, 1914 syn. nov. is considered a probable synonym of L. winteriana (Pfeiffer, 1842), P. trichotrochium Mollendorff, 1897 syn. nov. is a synonym of L. epiplatia (Mollendorff, 1897) and the preoccupied name Helix squamulosa Martens, 1867 syn. nov. is a synonym of L. madurensis sp. nov. We estimate that there are actually more than fifty species of Landouria in Java because many shell samples could not be classified and because no material is available from several regions of the island. A molecular phylogeny reveals that the species from Java do not form a monophyletic group, but that at least one species from Timor is nested within Javanese clades. This means that the Oriental Landouria crossed Wallace's line, the supposed border between the Oriental and Australo-Papuan regions, at least twice and supports the conclusion that Wallace's line does not represent a more severe barrier for terrestrial organisms than other straits through the archipelago. Within the Javanese clades, species from western and eastern Java are mixed, indicating frequent dispersals also within Java.

Dorylaimopsis longispicula sp. n. is characterized by cuticle with lateral differentiation consisting of four longitudinal rows of larger dots in pharyngeal and tail regions, two rows of larger dots elsewhere, long curved spicules, and 12-16 tubular precloacal supplements. Dorylaimopsis boucheri sp. n. is characterized by lateral differentiation consisting of 3-4 longitudinal rows of larger dots in males and 4-6 rows in females, beginning about 30 mu m posterior to amphids and terminating at the conical portion of the tail. 13-16 tubular precloacal supplements, and distal part of tail cylindrical without terminal setae. Dorylaimopsis jinyuei sp. n. is characterized by cuticle with lateral differentiation in the form of longitudinal rows of larger dots in two separate regions, not along entire body. One region is from posterior edge of amphid to anterior of intestine or anterior border of pharyngeal bulb in some females (4-7 longitudinal rows), the other is the tail region (5-7 longitudinal rows). In this paper, Dorylaimopsis metatypica Chitwood, 1936 is transferred to Hopperia because it is characterized by lateral differentiation consisting of larger, irregularly-distributed coarse dots (as in Hopperia), and Hopperia communis Gagarin & Nguyen, 2006 is transferred to Dorylaimopsis based on the presence of longitudinal rows of coarse dots and a cylindrical buccal cavity in most specimens of this species. A dichotomous key to valid species of Dorylaimopsis Ditlevsen, 1918 is provided.

MOLECULAR-DATA; TARDIGRADES; PHYLOGENY; ERECTION; GENERA; GENUS	Dastych (2016) analysed the holotype of Isohypsibius tetradactyloides (Richters, 1907) and noticed that it possesses a very faint cuticular sculpture. For this and other characters, Dastych considered the species to be a synonym of Isohypsibius asper (Murray, 1906). The authors re-examined specimens attributed to Isohypsibius tetradactyloides by Pilato (1971) from two Sicilian rivers, and noticed that they cannot be attributed to Isohypsibius asper but to a new species. This new species belongs to the I. asper group, and is described here as Isohypsibius occultus sp. nov.. As the very faint cuticular ornamentation can be difficult to observe, the authors compared the new species with species having smooth cuticle or ornamented cuticle. Species with cuticular gibbosities or annulations, or clearly different in other characters, i.e. those with only two macroplacoids, the presence of a septulum, and cuticular bars on the legs, were excluded from comparison.

Currently, only 13 species are known from East Asia, including areas in south China, Japan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Taiwan. In this work, we describe and illustrate a new species of 75popelti., from Vietnam and provide a new description for the male of T guangxiensis Haupt & Song, 1996. Additionally, we describe and illustrate the female gonopod of T. guangxiensis for the first time and propose a new homology hypothesis for the male gonopod parts. The male of T. laurentianus sp. n. is characterized by the unique patellar apophysis that presents a smooth texture and no spines. Typopeltis burentianu., sp. n. is the third species of this genus to he described from Vietnam.

J	Perissinotto, R				Perissinotto, Renzo			Description of a new species of Rhinocoeta Burmeister, 1842 (Scarabaeidae, Cetoniinae) from the South African Northern Cape	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Afrotropical region; Cetoniinae; new species; Northern Cape; Rhinocoeta; Xiphoscelidina	COLEOPTERA SCARABAEIDAE	Rhinocoeta namaqua sp. nov. is recognised as a separate species front its closest relative, R. cantata (Fabricius, 1,781) after a review and close analysis of specimens recently collected in the semiarid region of the Northern Cape Province, South Africa. The new species can be readily separated front R. comuta by the drastically reduced tubercle and associated depression on its anterior pronotal margin, particularly in the male. In addition, the general body shape of R. namaqua is more globose than that of R. cornuta, its average total length is larger, and its elytral costae are generally reduced and poorly visible, particularly at the level of the =bones. These characteristics make it practically impossible to separate the two sexes of R. namaqua, without inspection of the internal reproductive organs, as their external morphologies are virtually identical, unlike in R. comma. Finally, the aedeagal parameres of R. namaqua exhibit a narrower apex than those of R. cornuta and, in particular, lack the subapical hook-shaped lateral expansions that are so typical of all the other Rhinocoeta s. sir. species. The new species appears to be restricted to specific hioregions of the Sueculent and Nama Karoo biomes of the Northern Cape, and like all other species of the genus is generally found on or under mammal herbivore dung. Adult activity is limited to short periods immediately after rainfall events, during which individuals fly around and mate, but do not feed on either fruits or flowers.

Boreophilia insecuta (Eppelsheim), reported by Lohse (1990) from North America, is a misidentification of a new species, which is described here as B. neoinsecuta Klimaszewski, sp. n., and the true B. insecuta (Epp.) does not occur in North America. An additional new species is found in Alaska, and described as B. beringi Klimaszewski & Brunke, sp. n. The following three species arc synonymized (second name being valid): Boreophilia herschelensis Klimaszewski & Godin, 2012, with Boreophilia vega (Fenyes, 1920); Boreophilia manitobensis Lohse, 1990, with B. caseyi Lohse, 1990; and B. angusticornis (Bernahuer, 1907) with B. subplana (J Sahlberg, 1880), based on study of genital structures and external morphology. Atheta gelida J Sahlberg, 1887, and Atheta munsteri Bernhauer, 1902, considered as Boreophilia in recent publications, are transferred to the genus Atheta Thomson, subgenus Dimetrota. Boreostiba piligera (J Sahlberg) is transferred to Boreophilia based on morphology and the results of our phylogenetic analysis. Boreophilia nearctica is recorded from Alberta and B. nomensis is recorded from British Columbia for the first time. Each valid species is illustrated by color image of habitus, and black and white images of genitalia and tergite and sternite VIII. A new key to all Nearctic species of the genus is provided. DNA barcode data were available for nine of the 14 species, which we downloaded, analyzed, and used as additional evidence for the taxonomic conclusions reached herein.

In external morphology and genetic similarity of the 16S DNA barcode, Norops arenal is most similar to N. altae, N. fortunensis, N. fuscoauratus, N. gruuo, N. kemptoni, N. monteverde, N. pseudokemptoni, and N. tenorioensis. In morphology it shares with these species the following characteristics: (1) short hind limbs; (2) a single elongate prenasal scale; (3) tiny, smooth, often juxtaposed body scales; and (4) a slender habitus, often delicate. Norops arenal differs from these species, among several scalation details, by having a blackish central area in the male dewlap in life and in preservative (vs. no suffusion of black pigment on male dewlap in the other species), and a small red female dewlap in life (vs. dirty white, cream colored, or orange); extremely short hind legs with the tip of fourth toe of the adpressed hind leg reaching only to level of shoulder (vs. usually at least to level of ear in the other species); a short tail with a tail length/SVL ratio of 1.53 in single specimen with complete tail (vs. this ratio >1.6 in the other species); and a tiny size with 41.5 mm in single known adult male and 38.5 mm in single known adult female (vs. SVL of adults usually >42.0 mm). It further differs from N. altae, N. fuscoauratus, N. gruuo, N. pseudokemptoni, and N. tenorioensis by having a unilobed hemipenis (vs. bilobed in these five species).

NOV.; EUTARDIGRADA; ERECTION; PHYLOGENY; HALECHINISCIDAE	When listing the tardigrade species found in a study, the general practice is to sort the list alphabetically or taxonomically by genus. The first time a genus name is used it is spelled out and then it is abbreviated with the first letter of the genus followed by a full stop (period) until a different genus is encountered. This practice works for both a paragraph and a table listing and has been used by tardigrade researchers as far back as Schultze (1834). In the last monograph, Ramazzotti & Maucci (1983) presented a listing of the 52 generic abbreviations they used. We present an updated list of unambiguous abbreviations consistent with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) for the now 137 recognized tardigrade genera.

A new species of Bestiolina (Crustacea, Copepoda, Calanoida, Paracalanidae) from coastal waters of the Colombian Pacific, including a worldwide key for the identification of the species	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Coastal zone; crustaceans; estuaries; taxonomy; tropical zooplankton	ZOOPLANKTON	Plankton samples obtained from estuarine waters of the Colombian Pacific yielded adults specimens of an undescribed species of a paracalanid copepod of the genus Bestiolina. It most closely resembles two Asian species; B. sinica (Shen & Lee, 1966) from China and B. arabica (Ali, Al-Yamani & Prusova, 2007) from the Arabian Gulf. These three species share the absence of spinules on the posterior surfaces of exopod segments of legs 2, 3 and 4. Bestiolina sarae Dorado-Roncancio & Gaviria, sp. n. can be easily separated from B. sinica by the number of spinules on the anterior surface of endopod 2 of legs 2 and 3, and by the absence of spinules on the posterior surface of second endopod of leg 4. It can be distinguished from B. arabica by the presence of spinules on the posterior surface of endopod 2 of same legs (absent in B. arabica), and the size of spinules on the anterior surface of the same segments. The only other species known from the Americas, B. mexicana (Suarez-Morales & Almeyda-Artigas, 2016), can be distinguished from Bestiolina sarae Dorado-Roncancio & Gaviria, sp. n. by the presence of spinules on the posterior surface of the leg 2 first exopodal segment and the morphology of the mandible blade. The morphological and meristic differences to the eight known species of the genus are presented. An identification key to the species of Bestiolina is provided.

Six species are documented, one new species Lactura nalli Matson & Wagner, sp. n. is described, and two new synonymies are proposed: Lactura psammitis (Zeller, 1872), syn. n. and L. rhodocentra (Meyrick, 1913), syn. n. One new subspecies Lactura subfervens sapeloensis Matson & Wagner, ssp. n. is also described. Adult and larval stages, male and female genitalia, are illustrated, a preliminary phylogeny is presented based on nuclear and mitochondrial data, distribution records provided for verified specimens, and the biology and life history for each species is briefly characterized. Phylogenetic analyses, larval phenotypes, and life history information reveal that much of the historic taxonomic confusion rampant across this group in North America traces to the phenotypic variation in just one species, L. subfervens (Walker, 1854).

Limnonectes savan sp. nov. has males that bear a caruncle on top of the head, and most closely resembles L. dabanus from adjacent southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. However, the new species is readily distinguished from L. dabanus, and all other caruncle-bearing species of Limnonectes in mainland Southeast Asia, by its adult and larval morphology, mitochondrial DNA, and advertisement call. Its description brings the total number of caruncle-bearing species of Limnonectes to six.

The species in this clade are characterized by three light dorsal crossbands on the dorsum of juveniles and subadults whereas all other Paroedura species have four such bands. The new species differs from all species in the P bastardi complex in having the nostril in contact with the rostral scale. It is most similar to the sympatric P. tanjaka, from which it differs by the presence of prominent dorsal tubercles arranged in regular longitudinal rows (versus rather irregular rows of dorsal tubercles), smaller size, details of the dorsal colour pattern and strong genetic divergence.

Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA) and mitochondria) sequences (COI and 16S rRNA) of NEA short-bodied sphaerodorids revealed outstanding results including paraphyly of the genera Sphaerodoropsis, Sphaerodoridium, and Sphaerephesia. The number of longitudinal and transverse rows of dorsal macrotubercles is proposed as potential synapomorphies for the main clades, and are consequently herein used for the genera delimitation. The new classification proposed here implies nomenclatural changes and the erection of a new genus, Geminofilum gen. n., to accommodate the species previously considered as Sphaerodoropsis with two transverse rows of dorsal macrotubercles per segment.

Type material comparison of possible cryptic species of the genus Electrogena (Ephemeroptera, Heptageniidae) in Central Europe	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Electrogena samalorum; Electrogena ujhelyii; Electrogena rivuscellana; species inquirenda; synonymy; type series	SP-N; INTEGRATIVE TAXONOMY; MAYFLIES; IDENTIFICATION; ZURWERRA; TOMKA	The genus Electrogena Zurwerra & Tomka, 1985 is a diverse mayfly group in the Western Palaearctic with a partially unclear taxonomy, even in well-examined areas such as Central Europe. Recently, one of the species belonging to this genus, Electrogena ujhelyii (Sowa, 1981), was identified as a complex of genetically and geographically separated species. Two other species, Electrogena samalorum (Lancia, 1982) and Electrogena rivuscellana Sartori & Landolt, 1991 were formerly stated as junior synonyms of the earlier species. The fact that the synonymy of E. samalorum and E. ujhelyii was stated without comparison of any larval or adult material and both species reportedly have different altitude preferences makes the taxonomical position of E. samalorum (and possibly E. rivuscellana) questionable. Among others, a comparison of type series is one of the first methods that should be used to clarify the taxonomical position of closely related taxa. The present study aims to comparatively examine the type material and topotypes of E. ujhelyii and its presumed junior synonym E. samalorum for the first time in detail. Additionally, some notes on the status of the geographically extralimital E. rivuscellana are discussed briefly. We noted a significant similarity of all studied material from both the larval and imaginal stages, and suggest considering both junior synonyms (E. samalorum and E. rivuscellana) as species inquirendae.

However, in several regions within the state, the fruits are commonly infested by mealybugs (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha: Pseudococcidae). There is a lack of information about the mealybug species damaging this produce, so a survey of mealybug species associated with commercial sugar apple (Annona squamosa L.) and soursop (A. muricata L.) was conducted in the main production areas. The species Ferrisia virgata (Cockerell), Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green), Planococcus minor (Maskell), Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley and Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi Gimpel & Miller were found on both Annona species. Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell), Ferrisia dayslirii Kaydan & Gullan and Ferrisia malvastra (MacDaniel) were found only on soursop; and Ferrisia cristinae Kaydan & Gullan, Planococcus citri (Risso), Pseudococcus annonae sp. n. Pacheco da Silva & Kaydan and Pseudococcus sp. were found only on sugar apple. The species F. cristinae, F. dasylirii, F. malvastra and Ph. solenopsis are recorded infesting these hosts for the first time. The most abundant mealybug species found were F. virgata, Pl. minor, Ps. jackbeardsleyi and M. hirsutus, often forming heavy infestations and damaging the fruits. A new species, Pseudococcus annonae sp. n. Pacheco da Silva & Kaydan, is described and illustrated, and an identification key to the mealybug genera occurring on annonaceous species in the Neotropical region is also provided.

However, our knowledge of the termite fauna of the Ryukyu Archipelago is insufficient. Here, we report a new species of endemic drywood termite (Kalotermitidae) from the Ryukyu Archipelago. Our systematic study of the genus Neotermes (Isoptera: Kalotermitidae) from the Ryukyu-Taiwan Island arc using molecular and morphological methods found that N. koshunensis had also been composed of a second cryptic species, N. sugioi sp. nov. These two species are distributed allopatrically in the Ryukyu-Taiwan Island arc, with the former only in Taiwan and the latter only in the Ryukyu Archipelago. Our discovery of a new drywood termite species from the Ryukyu Archipelago suggests that both morphological and molecular assessments of the species now considered to be distributed widely in the Ryukyu-Taiwan Island arc are needed to clarify the termite fauna of the Ryukyu Archipelago.

The new species are classified and named as follows: Asynapta inflatoides sp. nov., A. rickebasta sp. nov., A. taigensis sp. nov., Camptomyia capitata sp. nov., C. hedmarki sp. nov., C. oldhammeri sp. nov., C. rhynchostylata sp. nov., and Stackelbergiella sikorai sp. nov. Specimens studied here prove the presence of both Asynapta inflatoides and A. taigensis in Finland, and of Stackelbergiella sikorai in Estonia. Other species new to the Finnish fauna are Asynapta thuraui Rubsaamen and Camptomyia ulmicola Mamaev, whereas Asynapta inflata Spungis has to be deleted from the Finnish checklist. Males of two species recorded in Sweden for the first time, and three species whose Swedish distribution is reconfirmed here, are redescribed: Asynapta baltica Spungis; A. inflata; Camptomyia fulva Mamaev; C. piptopori Panelius; and C. ulmicola. New junior synonyms recognized here are Niladmirara Fedotova syn. nov. (of Camptomyia Kieffer) and Asynapta panzari Jaschhof & Jaschhof syn. nov. (of A. breviata Spungis). The genitalic morphology of male Asynaptini is reinterpreted to include two pairs of parameres in the ancestral ground pattern. The extraordinary diversity of male genitalic structures found in asynaptine genera is highlighted, along with considerations of how this source of information can be exploited for the benefit of classification. Small-area remnants of ancient, naturally grown forest are shown to support populations of previously unnamed species of Asynaptini.

Here, we first present an extended description for Litoria pronimia Menzies, a small species that is widespread along the southern edge of the Central Cordillera of New Guinea, and in which males have a long and erectile rostral spike. Second, we describe Litoria pinocchio sp. nov. a new, morphologically similar, yet geographically disjunct species from the Foja Mountains in northern Papua Province, Indonesia. The new species differs from Litoria pronimia in aspects of body shape, proportions and colouration. A review of variation in the size, structure and degree of sexual dimorphism of the rostral spike across different species of Litoria suggests varying function including mate selection and camouflage.

In this paper we taxonomically revise the wingless click-beetle genus Neodima Schimmel & Platia, 1992 endemic to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. Neodima sichuanensis Schimmel & Platia, 1992 and N. cechovskyi Schimmel, 1998 are redescribed, and N. belousovi Prosvirov & Kundrata sp. nov. is described as new for science. The distribution and morphological diversity of Neodima is discussed, main diagnostic characters for all species are figured, and an identification key to the species of this genus is provided. Mouthparts as well as female pregenital segments and genitalia are described and figured for the first time for this genus. Further, we compare Neodima to morphologically similar genera, and discuss its systematic position within Dimini.

J	Pereira, JS; Rocha, CEF; Pinto, RL				Pereira, Julia S.; Rocha, Carlos E. F.; Pinto, Ricardo L.			On three new species of Elpidium Muller, 1880 and the re-description of Elpidium laesslei (Tressler, 1956) from Jamaica (Ostracoda: Podocopida: Limnocytheridae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Taxonomy; bromeliads; neotropical region	BROMELIAD; CRUSTACEA; PHYTOTELMATA; TREEFROGS; BIOLOGY	Elpidium ostracods are known by their very particular niche (water accumulated in tank-bromeliads), their relatively low dispersal ability and their dependency on amphibians for dispersal and colonization of new bromeliads. All these characteristics make the genus an interesting group for evolutionary, ecological and even taxonomic studies. However, the diversity of the group remains poorly studied. Here, we describe three new species of Elpidium, Elpidium littlei n. sp., Elpidium heberti n. sp. and Elpidium wolfi n. sp., and re-describe Elpidium laesslei, all from Jamaica. These species are characterized by a copulatory process with separated ejaculatory duct and distal glans, a feature so far unique within the genus. Each species can, in turn, be diagnosed by soft part and carapace morphology, most notably comparing hemipenis, valve ornamentation and degree of sexual dimorphism. The observed morphological diversity of Elpidium is discussed in relation to previous genetic estimates that suggested an even higher diversity in Jamaica. We point to intraspecific variation and lack of complete morphological descriptions as possible explanations. We also reaffirm the need of multidisciplinary studies in order to do more objective and secure taxonomic classifications in future studies.

(Crustacea: Amphipoda: Caprellidae) from the coast of New South Wales, Australia. In total eight species from these genera are recorded from the New South Wales coasts. Generic diagnoses of Orthoprotella, Metaprotella and Notoprotella gen. nov. are provided based on the present materials with recent detailed descriptions. The following five species are described in detail: Metaprotella guileri sp. nov., M. solitaria sp. nov., Notoprotella cornuta gen. nov., sp. nov., Notoprotella gordoni, new combination, and Orthoprotella australis. Metaprotella guileri sp. nov. is close to M. excentrica, but differs in pereonite 2 lacking a pair of pfosterior dorsal projections and lacking three distal small projections on the basis of gnathopod 2. Metaprotella solitaria sp. nov. is close to M. guileri sp. nov. and M. haswelliana, but differs from these species by the difference of projection formation of pereonites 2 to 3. Notoprotella cornuta gen. nov., sp. nov. is close to Notoprotella berentsae, but differs in having a mid-lateral projection near the base of gnathopod 2 and a distinct middorsal projection on pereonite 2. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:7E38CE67-297F-4187-A1DF-A2F3EAEC51D4	[Takeuchi, Ichiro] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Takeuchi, Ichiro] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Ctr Adv Technol Environm, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Takeuchi, Ichiro; Lowry, James K.] Australian Museum, Res Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia	Takeuchi, I (reprint author), Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan.	takeuchi@agr.ehime-u.ac.jp			Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)	The present study was partially conducted as the overseas visiting program supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science, Japan to IT.		50	0	0	0	1	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0022-2933	1464-5262		J NAT HIST	J.

Morphologically, these northeast Indian populations differ from other natricines by having a single ('fused' or unpaired) internasal shield and a single prefrontal shield. Given the morphological and phylogenetic distinctiveness of these northeast Indian populations, we refer them to a new genus, Smithophis gen. nov., and transfer Rhabdops bicolor (Blyth, 1854) to Smithophis bicolor comb. nov. Based on morphological and molecular variation within our northeast Indian sample, we additionally describe Smithophis atemporalis sp. nov. from the state of Mizoram.

The analysis is based on the morphological examination (wing pattern and genitalia) of the type series of most species, as well as of large series of additional material. Additionally, DNA barcode data were used as an extra line of information. As result, Triphosa agnata Le Cerf, 1918 syn. n. is synonymized with T sabaudiata (Duponchel, 1830), the taxonomy of the enigmatic Triphosa taochata Lederer, 1870 is clarified, and two species are described as new to science: T silviae sp. n. and T lecerfi sp. n.. Hydria ravulata (Staudinger, 1892) comb. rev., is transferred from Triphosa to the genus Hydria. Lectotypes are designated for Triphosa taochata and Hydria ravulata. Wing pattern, genitalia and diagnostic characters of all examined species are illustrated and the distribution data shown on the map.

Macrostomum shenda n. sp. differs from its congeners in the oblique and non-thickening distal opening of its narrow funnel-shaped stylet. In addition, its sperm have neither bristles nor brush, and are surrounded by an undulating membrane in the midbody region. In M spiriger n. sp., the stylet is spirally twisted. Its reproductive apparatus has a seminal bursal pore opening exteriorly. Results of the 18S and 28S rDNA phylogenetic analyses also support the establishments of these two new species. Moreover, the 18S and 28S rDNA sequences of some species within Macrostomum in previous studies have been revised to avoid ambiguity, while Macrostomum dongyuanensis Wang & Sun, 2015 was re-identified as a new record of M quiritium Kolasa, 1973 from China.

J	Li, X; Zhou, W; Che, XJ				Li, Xu; Zhou, Wei; Che, Xing-Jin			Loaches of Vanmanenia (Cypriniformes: Gastromyzontidae) from Yunnan, China with Description of a New Species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Morphological comparison; taxonomy; Vanmanenia microcephala; new species; Vanmanenia striata	TELEOSTEI; PATTERNS	After comparing specimens of Vanmanenia collected from the Lancang-jiang (the upper Mekong River), Yuan Jiang (the upper Red River), Lixian-jiang (first branch of the Red River), and Jinsha-jiang (the upper Yangtze River) drainages in Yunnan, China, we considered the specimens of Vanmanenia from Shunbi Township, Yangbi County, Yunnan (a branch of the Lancang-jiang drainage basin, the upper Mekong River) a new species, herein named V. microcephala sp. nov. Our investigation also suggested that V. striata should be restored as a valid species. On the basis of the systematic comparison of morphological characteristics of the genus Vanmanenia and based on the combination of the characteristics of the rostral fold, rostral barbels, the bars/marks on the flank, the rows of spots on the paired fins, and the markings on the caudalfm base, the loaches of Vanmanenia should be divided into three groups: 1) the barred group, characterized by bars on the flank, 2), the cusped rostral fold group, characterized by the rostral fold lobes forming a cusp process, and 3) the barbeled rostral fold group, characterized by the rostral fold lobes specialized as secondary barbels. The barred group differs from congeners in Vanmanenia by the following combination of characters: three rostral lobes with a smooth and arcuate outer edge, a pattern of bars on the flank, and spotless paired fins. This group includes six species: V. crassicauda, V. microcephala sp. nov., V. serrilineata, V. striata, V. tettraloba, and Vanmanenia pseudostriata. The new species, V. microcephala, differs from the other species in the barred group by the following combination of characters: the lateral side of the body with 14-22 vermiculations with widths smaller than the diameter of the eye; the dorsal side of the head covered with a large black blotch; the gill opening smaller and its upper angle aligned with the lower edge of the eye; and the head smaller, head depth 45.2-47.1% head length.

This clade is the new subtribe Levieina, represented by seven new species in three new genera. Within Leviea gen. n. are three new species, L. herberti sp. n., L. lornae sp. n., and L. francesae sp. n., all of which are unusual among the myrmarachnines in appearing as typical salticids, not antlike. Papuamyr gen. n. superficially resembles Ligonipes Karsch, 1878 or Rhombonotus L. Koch, 1879 as a compact antlike spider, but lacks their laterally-compressed palp and bears an ectal spur on the paturon of the chelicera. Two species of Papuamyr gen. n. are described, Papuamyr omhifosga sp. n. and P. pandora sp. n. Agorioides gen. n., containing A. cherubino sp. n. and A. papagena sp. n., is antlike, with the carapace sunken inwards (concave) between the posterior lateral and posterior median eyes. Phylogenetic analysis of data from the 28S, 16SND1, and COI gene regions of 29 species of myrmarachnines shows that the three new genera form a clade that is sister to the subtribe Myrmarachnina (Myrmarachne sensu lato), with the subtribe Ligonipedina less closely related.

The genus Mecodema Blanchard 1853 (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Broscini) from the North Island, New Zealand	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Brullea; conservation; Diglymma; Metaglymma; Nothobroscina; Oregus; Orthoglymma; pitfall traps	GROUND BEETLES; NATIVE FOREST; HABITAT; DISTURBANCE; HISTORY	Mecodema (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Broscini) is a hyperdiverse endemic New Zealand genus of ground beetles with only a few geographically widespread species found throughout the two main islands, as well as many offshore islands. Using specimens from a number of private and institutional collections, in addition new specimens were acquired by extensive pitfall trapping, we describe or redescribe all of the known North Island Mecodema species. Additionally, we redescribe three South Island species from the former genus Metaglymma, as morphological evidence shows that these species are nested within Mecodema. Species descriptions are formed by using 128 morphological characters, which include external characters, as well as both male and female internal structures. There are four new combinations: Mecodema antarctica comb. n., M aberrans comb. n., M moniliferum comb. n. and M tibiale comb. n. We synonymise M occiputale under Mecodema curvidens, and M sulcatum under Mecodema oblongum, and reinstate M scitulum Broun (northwest Hunua Range, Auckland). Twenty four new species are described: Mecodema argentum sp. n., M atuanui sp. n., M dunnorum sp. n., M genesispotini sp. n., M godzilla sp. n., M. jacinda sp. n., M kipjac sp. n., M kokoroiho sp. n., M mohi sp. n., M ngaiatonga sp. n., M ngaitahuhu sp. n., M papake sp. n., M perexiguus sp. n., M rusticulus sp. n., M tern ata sp. n., M teparawhau sp. n., M teroroa sp. n., M tewhara sp. n., M tuhoe sp. n., M undecimus sp. n., M wharekahika sp. n., M xylanthrax sp. n., M yconomus sp. n., M zonula sp. n. North Island regional species endemism is very high in North-land (15/16 endemic species), with species becoming more widespread in the southern regions, e.g. Wellington only has two endemic species from a total of eight species. This research increases the total number of described Mecodema species to 102, and will allow a modem taxonomic framework for completion of the revision of the South Island species.	[Fls, David S.

Exploring insect biodiversity: the parasitic Hymenoptera, chiefly Chalcidoidea, associated with seeds of asphodels (Xanthorrhoeaceae), with the description of nine new species belonging to Eurytomidae and Torymidae	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Trophic relationships; phenology; phytophagy; distribution; Europe	EVOLUTION; WASPS; EUPELMIDAE; HOST	An account is given of the communities of Chalcidoidea, mostly based upon species of Bruchophagus Ashmead (Eurytomidae), which feed as larvae in seeds of Asphodelus and Asphodeline (Xanthorrhoeaceae). Eight new species of Eurytomidae, namely B. abscedus Askew sp. n., B. asphodelinae Askew & Stojanova sp. n., B. gijswijti Askew & Ribes sp. n., B. insulare Delvare sp. n., B. lecomtei Delvare sp. n., B. ribesi Askew sp. n., Eurytoma genale Askew & Stojanova sp. n., and Aximopsis balajasi Delvare sp. n., are described together with the new species Idiomacromerus asphodeli Ribes sp. n. (Torymidae). Eurytoma setigera Mayr, 1878 is again synonymized with E. pistaciae Rondani, 1877 syn. rev. Puklina dillerae Doganlar, 1993 and P asphodelinae Boyadzhiev, 2003 are synonymized with P depilata Graham, 1987 syn n. The use, respectively of the mitochondrial genes CO/ and Cyt B and of the nuclear gene EF1-a, allowed us to discriminate pairs of sibling species in the three genera of Eurytomidae and to circumscribe the limits of the hypervariable Eurytoma asphodeli Hedqvist, 1976. The trophic webs associated with five species/subspecies of asphodels are fully described and illustrated, the distributions of the chalcid wasps involved are figured, and the phenology of the most common species is quoted and figured.

Koch, the "mexicanus" group is composed of species distributed in the mountains of Mexico. This group presents taxonomic problems, because its characterization and the species included in the group have varied through the years. In the present work, we redefine this group based on several morphological characters, and we differentiate it from the other two species groups within the genus: "vorhiesi" and "nit dulus+ nigrescens". Additionally, five new species are described: Vaejovis ceboruco sp. nov., Vaejovis nanchititla sp. nov., Vaejovis santibagnezi sp. nov., Vaejovis talpa sp. nov. and Vaejovis tapalpa sp. nov; the males of three species are described for the first time (V. dugesi, V. nigrofemoratus and V. tesselatus); and the updated diagnosis for all species is included. Keys for the identification of males and females of the 30 species included in this group are given. Lastly, notes on the natural history and distribution of some species are provided, with maps of known distribution for all the species.

Here, we describe the first fossil millipede of the order Callipodida, Burmanopetalum inexpectatum gen. nov. et sp. nov., found in early Cenomanian amber of Burma, 98.79 +/- 0.62 Mya. The species possesses a number of morphological traits that exclude it from all extant suborders, and Burmanopetalidea suborder nov. and Burmanopetalidae fam. nov. are here erected to accommodate it. The new suborder can be recognized by the following unique characters: pleurotergal setae absent; telson with a specific spatulate shape twice the size of the penultimate body ring; hypoproct devoid of setae; and eyes composed of five well-separated ommatidia. While the callipodidan habitus seems to have remained generally unchanged for at least 99 million years, pleurotergal and hypoproctal setation, as well as the complexity of eyes in ground-dwelling forms may have evolved recently in the order. As B. inexpectatum gen. nov. et sp. nov. is the first true callipodidan in the fossil record, the minimum age of Callipodida is thus at least 99 Mya.

Dylan			Life in wood: preliminary phylogeny of deep-sea wood-boring bivalves (Xylophagaidae), with descriptions of three new genera and one new species	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES			English	Article							PHOLADIDAE XYLOPHAGAINAE; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; COMMUNITY; PACIFIC; MYOIDA; FALLS; PHOLADOIDEA; SUCCESSION; DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE	Xylophagaid bivalves link terrestrial and deep-sea ecosystems by making energy and nutrients from sunken wood available to other animals. They bore into what can be sulphide-rich wood with their valves and digest it using bacterial enzymes. The evolutionary history of the roughly 60 named xylophagaid species remains largely unknown. We sequenced 18S and 28S rDNA genes of 59 specimens from the northeastern Pacific, southwestern Pacific off New Zealand and the Atlantic Ocean. We analysed these together with data from GenBank (thus increasing the species represented by sequences from 7 to 22) using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to reconstruct the group's phylogeny. Newly discovered taxa are: Spiniapex gilsonorum n. gen., n. sp.; Feaya n. gen. (for Xylopholas dostwous) and Abditoconus n. gen. (for X. heterosiphon, X. anselli and X. brava that share a two-parted siphon and a periostracal cone). Specimens of Xyloredo from New Zealand, Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and California USA are a single species. The genus Xylopholas is not unequivocally monophyletic; the presence/absence of a faecal mass in the distal intestine is the most conspicuous difference between the species included. The mesoplax (paired calcified plates over the anterior adductor) evolved convergently in two distinct clades assigned to the genus Xylophaga, which is not monophyletic. All clades represented by at least four taxa occur in every geographic area included. Rather than evolving to exploit sulphide associated with wood falls, xylophagaids may have evolved protection from it. This is indicated by the fact that in four clades, a thick periostracum covers the siphons that extend through the wood, while packed faecal pellets surround the siphons in one subclade, perhaps providing a physical barrier. In only one clade are fleshy siphons exposed to the wood.	[Voight, Janet R.; Grewe, Felix; Maddox, J.

Despite its cosmopolitan distribution, only a few species currently comprise the genus Plagiopyla, and their data are often incomplete, whereas the other genera are monotypic. Indeed, these anaerobic ciliates are a somewhat challenging issue for protistologists: they have a cryptic lifestyle, they are not easily cultivable and they possess few and cryptic taxonomic features, which makes it extremely difficult to identify them at species level. In the present paper we provide a revision of the family Plagiopylidae based on morphological and molecular analyses, together with the description of two novel species of Plagiopyla, P. ramani sp. nov. and P. narasimhamurtii sp. nov., and a redescription of P. nasuta, all collected from the freshwater Kolleru Lake (Andhra Pradesh, India). We applied an integrative taxonomic approach to characterize these organisms, while introducing the description of novel morphological features not recorded in previous works. After critically revising the family Plagiopylidae, we propose the exclusion of the genus Paraplagiopyla from this family and that the genus Lechriopyla should be considered a junior synonym of Plagiopyla. We consequently propose L. mystax as Plagiopyla mystax comb. nov.

Hypselodoris is monophyletic and divided into Glades that exhibit varying support. Novel diversity was found, with the distinctness of 17 new species of Hypselodoris supported by the molecular phylogeny, subsequent species delimitation analysis and morphological data.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis and comparative morphology reveals the diversity and distribution of needle nematodes of the genus Longidorus (Dorylaimida: Longidoridae) from Spain	CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY			English	Article						belowground diversity; Bayesian inference; CoxI; D-2-D-3 expansion domains of 28S rRNA gene; integrative taxonomy	REVISED POLYTOMOUS KEY; N-SP NEMATODA; LAEVICAPITATUS WILLIAMS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; XIPHINEMA; IDENTIFICATION; MICOLETZKY; DIAGNOSTICS; COUNTRIES; FRAMEWORK	The genus Longidorus constitutes a large group of approximately 170 species of plant-ectoparasitic nematodes that are polyphagous and distributed almost worldwide. Some of the species of this genus are-vectors of plant viruses. Species discrimination in Longidorus is difficult because the morphology is very conservative, and morphometric characters often overlap, leading to potential misidentification. Integrative-taxonomy, based on the combination of molecular analyses with morphology, is a useful and necessary approach in Longidorus-species identification. In Spain from 2014 to 2017, we conducted nematode surveys among cultivated and wild plants, from which we identified 13 populations of Longidorus, two of which appeared to represent new species and are described herein as L. iliturgiensis sp. nov. and L. pacensis sp. nov., and 11 populations belonging to eight known species: L. africanus, L. baeticus, L. carpetanensis, L. fasciatus, L. nevesi, L. cf. olegi, L. pini, and L. vallensis. Three species are new geographical records for Spain (L. nevesi, L. cf. olegi, and L. africanus). We report molecular data for L. nevesi, L. cf. olegi, L. carpetanensis and L. pini for the first time. Additionally, we describe the males of L. pini and the juveniles of L. cf. olegi.

Specimens of stoloniferous octocorals were collected during fieldwork along the coasts of two islands (Okinawa and Iriomote) in the Okinawa Prefecture. Despite their phenotypic polyp variation, this study shows their morphological and molecular uniqueness, leading to the description of a new genus with a single species: Hanabira yukibana, gen. nov., sp. nov. They are placed within the Clavulariidae and form a sister clade basally to the genus Knopia Alderslade & McFadden, 2007 and species of Clavularia Blainville, 1830. The polyps of this new species show morphological variation in both shape and sclerite density, but there is conformity in the typical overall petal shaped tentacles, which have fused pinnules (pseudopinnules). Depending on the densities of their sclerites and their photosynthetic endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) of the family Symbiodiniaceae, there is a characteristic sheen present in the tentacles. Moreover, the zooxanthellae hosted by our specimens form a clear, small-scale biogeographic pattern; all H. yukibana specimens from Okinawa Island contained zooxanthellae of the genus Clado-copium Lajeunesse & H.J. Jeong, 2018 (= former Symbiodinium 'Clade C') and all specimens from Iriomote Island hosted zooxanthellae of the genus Durusdinium LaJeunesse, 2018 (= former Symbiodinium 'Clade D'). These results show the potential for variation among the Symbiodiniaceae floras within octocorals, something that has not yet been investigated for the large majority of zooxanthellate octocoral species.

Despite being second largest eutardigrade order, phylogenetic relationships and systematics within this group remain largely unresolved. Broad taxon sampling, especially within one of the most speciose tardigrade genera, Isohypsibius Thulin, 1928, and application of both comparative morphological methods (light contrast and scanning electron microscopy imaging of external morphology and buccal apparatuses) and phylogenetic framework (18S + 28S rRNA sequences) resulted in the most comprehensive study devoted to this order so far. Two new families are erected from the currently recognised family Isohypsibiidae: Doryphoribiidae fam. nov., comprising all aquatic isohypsibioids and some terrestrial isohypsibioid taxa equipped with the ventral lamina; and Halobiotidae fam. nov., secondarily marine eutardigrades with unique adaptations to sea environment. We also split Isohypsibius into four genera to accommodate phylogenetic, morphological and ecological variation within the genus: terrestrial Isohypsibius s. s. (Isohypsibiidae), with smooth or sculptured cuticle but without gibbosities; terrestrial Dianea gen. nov. (Isohypsibiidae), with small and pointy gibbosities; terrestrial Ursulinius gen. nov. (Isohypsibiidae), with large and rounded gibbosities; and aquatic Grevenius gen. nov. (Doryphoribiidae fam. nov.), typically with rough cuticle and claws with branches of very similar heigths. Claw morphology is reviewed and, for the first time, shown to encompass a number of morphotypes that correlate with clades recovered in the molecular analysis. The anatomy of pharynx and cuticle are also shown to be of high value in distinguishing supraspecific taxa in Isohypsibioidea. Taxonomy of all isohypsibioid families and genera is discussed, with special emphasis on the newly erected entities. Finally, a dychotomous diagnostic key to all currently recognised isohypsibioid families and genera is provided.

Towards a phylogeny of Cyclops (Copepoda): (in)congruences among morphology, molecules and zoogeography	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA			English	Article							IDENTIFICATION KEY; YUCATAN PENINSULA; LAKE BAIKAL; N-SP; CRUSTACEA; GENUS; SYSTEMATICS; CALANOIDA; EVOLUTION; MODEL	The phylogeny of Cyclops (similar to 30 spp.), a predominantly Palearctic cold-adapted genus, was reconstructed based on morphological and molecular characters. The morphological analysis used extensive taxon sampling from the entire Holarctic range of the genus and included 53 morphological characters. Polymorphic traits were coded by the "unordered," "unscaled" and "scaled" methods; maximum parsimony criterion was applied in tree building. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions utilized partial nuclear 18S and 28S ribosomal genes, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and complete internal transcribed spacer regions I and II, albeit with limited taxon sampling. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood were used in these tree reconstructions. The molecular characters were used both in combination with morphology and as an independent test of the basal relationships inferred from morphology. Monophyly of the genus received strong support in both the morphological and molecular phylogenies; the basal relationships remain unresolved. The morphology-based phylogenies, along with the geographic distribution patterns and ecological traits, supported monophyly of the ankyrae-ladakanus clade, scutifer-clade (C. scutifer, C. jashnovi, C. columbianus), kolensis-clade (C. kolensis, C. kikuchii, C. vicinus, C. furcifer, C. insignis, C. alaskaensis), abyssorum-clade (C. abyssorum s. str., C. abyssorum larianus, C. ricae, C. sevani) and divergens-clade (South Carpathian "Cyclops sp. Y," C. mauritaniae, C. divergens, C. bohater, C. lacustris). Relationships among European and North American populations of C. scutifer and C. columbianus based on partial sequences of the 12S mitochondrial gene show C. scutifer to be paraphyletic, suggesting two independent invasions into North America via the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia to Alaska.

Revisiting the North American freshwater mussel genus Quadrula sensu lato (Bivalvia Unionidae): Phylogeny, taxonomy and species delineation	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA			English	Article							DELIMITATION METHOD; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; SYSTEMATICS; SOFTWARE; MODEL	Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia, Unionidae) have suffered strong declines over the last century. High morphological plasticity of Unionidae causes disturbances in their systematics and taxonomy, hampering conservation efforts. Species that have historically been placed under the North American genus Quadrula have suffered from numerous taxonomic and species delineation problems since its inception. Four genera are presently recognized within Quadrula sensu lato, that is, Cyclonaias, Quadrula, Theliderma and Tritogonia, but their phylogenetic basis remains incompletely tested. In the present study, we reconstructed several two-marker (mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I-COI and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1-ND1) phylogenies with newly collected specimens and all previously available sequences covering most species within this group. We then delineated the species within the group using an integrative approach with the application of molecular statistical methods, morphometric (Fourier Shape) analyses and geographic distribution data. Four clades corresponding to these genera were consistently recovered in all phylogenies. To validate the generic status of these clades, molecular analyses were complemented with morphological, anatomical and ecological data compiled from the literature. Several revisions are here proposed to the current systematics and taxonomy of these genera, including the synonymization of Cyclonaias asperata under Cyclonaias kieneriana; the inclusion of Quadrula apiculata and Quadrula rumphiana under Quadrula quadrula; the placement of Quadrula nobilis under Tritogonia; and finally the separation of the Mobile River basin populations of Theliderma metanevra as a new species, that is, Theliderma johnsoni n. sp.

Phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of the South American mayfly genus Brasilocaenis Puthz, 1975 (Insecta: Ephemeroptera: Caenidae)	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Pannota; Caeninae; Phylogeny; Taxonomy; New species; New combinations	STEPHENS; RECORDS; GENERA	Brasilocaenis Puthz, 1975 is a South American genus of Caenidae (Ephemeroptera). Except for their very distinct male genitalia, the species of this genus are morphologically similar to South American species of Caenis. We analysed the phylogenetic relationships among Brasilocaenis and related genera using morphological characters of both nymphs and adults and cladistic methods. This first phylogenetic analysis of Brasilocaenis was based on a matrix of 20 species, including six species of Brasilocaenis and 14 species of different genera (Alloretochus, Caenis, Clypeocaenis and Tasmanocaenis), and 35 characters analysed under implied weights (k = 3). The analysis supports the monophyly of Brasilocaenis with a single synapomorphy - forceps fused with the styliger plate. South American Caenis form a paraphyletic group, with Brasilocaenis nested among them. Biogeographical analysis (spatial analysis of vicariance) based on distributional records for each species revealed seven vicariant events, the most important of which are: (i) a north-south separation coincident with a split between the Amazon and Atlantic forests, and (ii) two west-east separations in tropical South America indicating different historical events. We additionally describe Brasilocaenis atawallpa sp. n. from male imagos from Colombia, and suggest an amended diagnosis to include Brasilocaenis amacayacu n. comb. and Brasilocaenis elidioi n. comb.

GEN.; CRUSTACEA; CRABS; PYRENEES; VICENZA; SYSTEMATICS; PALEOCENE; TURNOVER	We describe Aragolambrus collinsin. gen., n. sp. from the Eocene (Ypresian) of Huesca, Aragon, northern Spain, which represents the second report of a fossil Parthenopidae from Spain and the first from the Eocene. Aragolambrus collinsin. gen. n. sp. is considered one of the oldest parthenopid crabs, and important morphological features include the shape and size of tubercles of the proto- and mesogastric lobes and the morphology and ornamentation of the chelipeds. The shape of the carapace and orbits of the new species are similar to other Parthenopidae and the distribution and number of the tubercles of the inner margin of the manus suggest inclusion in the subfamily Daldorfiinae. Aragolambrus collinsin. gen., n. sp. occurred in coral-algae reefs associated with a rich benthic biota of corals, red algae, echinoderms, molluscs, crustaceans, and fishes within the mesophotic zone. A review of all parthenopid Eocene occurrences suggests that the group originated in reef environments and later occupied more open marine conditions with siliciclastic substrates.

J	de Leon, GPP; Hernandez-Mena, DI				Perez-Ponce de Leon, G.; Hernandez-Mena, D., I			Testing the higher-level phylogenetic classification of Digenea (Platyhelminthes, Trematoda) based on nuclear rDNA sequences before entering the age of the "next-generation' Tree of Life	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Review						Taxonomy; Digenea; Trematoda; rDNA; NGS; phylogeny	COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMES; SYSTEMATIC POSITION; N. SP; EVOLUTION; GENES	Digenea Carus, 1863 represent a highly diverse group of parasitic platyhelminths that infect all major vertebrate groups as definitive hosts. Morphology is the cornerstone of digenean systematics, but molecular markers have been instrumental in searching for a stable classification system of the subclass and in establishing more accurate species limits. The first comprehensive molecular phylogenetic tree of Digenea published in 2003 used two nuclear rRNA genes (ssrDNA = 18S rDNA and lsrDNA = 28S rDNA) and was based on 163 taxa representing 77 nominal families, resulting in a widely accepted phylogenetic classification. The genetic library for the 28S rRNA gene has increased steadily over the last 15 years because this marker possesses a strong phylogenetic signal to resolve sister-group relationships among species and to infer phylogenetic relationships at higher levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. Here, we have updated the database of 18S and 28S rRNA genes until December 2017, we have added newly generated 28S rDNA sequences and we have reassessed phylogenetic relationships to test the current higher-level classification of digeneans (at the subordinal and subfamilial levels). The new dataset consisted of 1077 digenean taxa allocated to 106 nominal families for 28S and 419 taxa in 98 families for 18S. Overall, the results were consistent with previous higher-level classification schemes, and most superfamilies and suborders were recovered as monophyletic assemblages. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, new phylogenetic hypotheses from complete mitochondrial genomes have been proposed, although their power to resolve deep levels of trees remains controversial. Since data from NGS methods are replacing other widely used markers for phylogenetic analyses, it is timely to reassess the phylogenetic relationships of digeneans with conventional nuclear rRNA genes, and to use the new analysis to test the performance of genomic information gathered from NGS, e.g. mitogenomes, to infer higher-level relationships of this group of parasitic platyhelminths.

Survey of trematodes in intertidal snails from Patagonia, Argentina: new larval forms and diversity assessment	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article							LEPOCREADIUM-AREOLATUM LINTON; LIFE-HISTORY; SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY; LITTORINA-SAXATILIS; LARUS-DOMINICANUS; DIGENEAN LARVAE; KELP GULL; SP-NOV; COAST; MORPHOLOGY	Larval trematodes are the main parasites of snails, and they play a crucial role because they usually castrate their snail hosts and can thus alter their population and community dynamics. This study involved a survey of seven gastropod species (Crepipatella dilatata, Fissurella radiosa, Nacella magellanica, Pareuthria fuscata, Siphonaria lessonii, S. lateralis and Trophon geversianus) parasitized by 12 trematode species (one hemiurid, one gymnophallid, two lepocreadiids, two microphallids, one notocotylid, two renicolids, one philophtalmid, one schistosomatid and one zoogonid) from southern Patagonia (47 degrees S, 65 degrees W), Argentina. Only F. radiosa was free of parasites. The study included the description of five new larvae, based on morphological and molecular information, and a comparison of the parasite diversity with that of a northern locality (42 degrees S, 64 degrees W), characterized by a lower mollusc diversity. Species richness and diversity of parasites were higher in the southern site. This suggests a correlation between the level of parasitism and the diversity of molluscs (first intermediate hosts), which is higher at the high-latitude site and seems to attract shorebirds, which disperse the digenean eggs and facilitate the completion of their life cycles. These results support the notion that parasitism is influenced by large-scale factors such as biogeographical patterns, and small-scale factors such as diversity or abundance of intermediate and definitive hosts.

A new heligmonellid (Nematoda) species of the genus Stilestrongylus in Euryoryzomys russatus (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae) in the Atlantic Forest, southern Brazil	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article							TRICHOSTRONGYLINA	A new species of Nippostrongylinae (Nematoda: Heligmonellidae), Stilestrongylus rolandoi n. sp., is described from specimens collected from the small intestine of the rodent Euryoryzomys russatus in the Atlantic Forest (Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil). The genus Stilestrongylus includes 23 species, which parasitize rodents occurring in the Neotropical region. Stilestrongylus aureus (Durette-Desset & Sutton, 1985) from Argentina, S. azarai (Durette-Desset & Sutton, 1985) from Argentina, S. flavescens (Sutton & Durette-Desset, 1991) from Uruguay, S. franciscanus (Digiani & Durette-Desset, 2002) from Argentina, S. gracielae (Digiani & Durette-Desset, 2006) from Argentina, and S. oryzomysi (Sutton & Durette-Desset, 1991) from Argentina are closely related to Stilestrongylus rolandoi n. sp., all having caudal bursa patterns of types 1-4 in one of the lobes. Stilestrongylus rolandoi n. sp. is distinguished from the aforementioned species by its ray 6 being short in relation to rays 4 and 5, which are long and robust, and by having caudal bursa patterns of types 1-4 in both lobes. The new species has 27 ridges in the mid-body in males, and 24 in females, and has one of the highest ratios of spicule length to body length (21-33%) in this genus.	[Boullosa, R. G.; Simoes, R.

Morphological descriptions are provided, including line drawings of the new species, light microscopic images of the four species, and scanning electron micrographs of A.mesoamericanus sp. nov. Nine D2-D3 28S rRNA gene sequences of variable length are obtained for four species, and analyzed with Bayesian inference. The new species are compared to their relatives, and new relevant information about the known species is given. Morphological data and 28S sequences are used to analyze the evolutionary relationships of the genus and to elucidate its phylogeny with an integrative approach. Thus, the monophyly of Aporcelinus is confirmed on the basis of a definite and recognizable morphological pattern and a highly supported clade obtained by means of molecular genetic analysis. Its internal evolutionary relationships are not definitely resolved, but according to this analysis the new species share a recent ancestor, and are closer to other South American species than to the representative from the Asian Far East. Doubts are raised about the classification of Aporcelinus under Aporcelaimidae, as originally proposed, as molecular genetic analysis shows a tentative closer (but not highly supported) relationship with Allodorylaimus, a member of the family Qudsianematidae.

Here, we utilize it to examine the systematics and taxonomy of a newly recognized amphipod species, Gammarus hamaticornis n. sp., which belongs to a highly diverse genus of endemic freshwater crustaceans that show very limited morphological differentiation. Since this species is endemic to northern Dobrogea, a region at the northwestern Black Sea coast devoid of permafrost during the Last Glacial Maximum, we hypothesized that it survived insitu during the Quaternary climatic oscillations. We first examined the phylogenetic position of Gammarus hamaticornis n. sp. within the genus and then compared its morphology, phylogeography, distribution, and climatic niche with that of its sister species. Results indicate that G.hamaticornis n. sp. is most closely related to its widely distributed northern neighbor, G.kischineffensis, and a remarkable agreement was observed among morphological, multilocus coalescent and climatic analyses which supported the distinctiveness of both taxa. These apparently diverged during the Pliocene from a common ancestor that likely colonized freshwaters from the adjacent brackish basins of the shrinking Paratethys. The results indicate that G.hamaticornis n. sp. has persisted throughout the Pleistocene in northern Dobrogea, a hitherto hypothesized refugium confirmed for the first time with molecular genetic data. Due to its narrow geographical range, rarity in the local communities and highly fluctuating nature of the streams it inhabits, this species should be in the focus of future conservation priorities.

Welcome back Janolidae and Antiopella: Improving the understanding of Janolidae and Madrellidae (Cladobranchia, Heterobranchia) with description of four new species	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Antiopella; Indo-Pacific; Janolidae; Janolus; Madrellidae	DELIMITATION METHOD; PACIFIC COAST; NORTH-AMERICA; DNA-SEQUENCES; JANOLUS BERGH; OPISTHOBRANCHIA; GASTROPODA; GENUS; MOLLUSCA; CLASSIFICATION	Proctonotidae and Madrellidae are families that belong to the suborder Cladobranchia. Historically, both have been the subjects of taxonomic confusion. Thus, Proctonotidae Gray, 1853, was subsequently named as Zephyrinidae Iredale and O'Donoghue, 1923 and Janolidae Pruvot-Fol, 1933, but currently both are considered as synonyms of Proctonotidae. On the other hand, Alder and Hancock (1864) erected the genus Madrella in Proctonotidae. Here, we completed a detailed morphological and molecular study of four apparently undescribed species of Madrellidae and Proctonotidae from the Indo-Pacific. We performed a maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses using two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes to improve the understanding of the families. Prompted by our results, Janolidae is removed from synonymy with Proctonotidae. Within Janolidae, there are two well-supported clades. One includes species with smooth cerata that are found in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. The taxa in this clade include the type species of Antiopella and several other species. We resurrect Antiopella as the valid name for this clade. The sister clade to Antiopella includes a variety of taxa with species that have been traditionally included in Janolus Bergh, 1884 and Bonisa Gosliner, 1981. Further systematic revision requires more comprehensive taxon sampling. The new species discovered have clear morphological differences and strong molecular support. They include Madrella amphora Pola and Gosliner sp. nov., Janolus tricellariodes Pola and Gosliner sp. nov., Janolus flavoanulatus Pola and Gosliner sp. nov., and Janolus incrustans Pola and Gosliner sp. nov.

Redescription and taxonomic status of Dipturus chilensis (Guichenot, 1848), and description of Dipturus lamillai sp. nov. (Rajiformes: Rajidae), a new species of long-snout skate from the Falkland Islands	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Chondrichthyes; batoids; long-nosed skates; southeastern Pacific; diversification patterns; taxonomy	ZEARAJA-CHILENSIS; ROUGHSKIN SKATE; CHONDRICHTHYES; TRACHYDERMA; BIODIVERSITY; ZOOGEOGRAPHY; GROWTH; AGE	Recent molecular evidence has called into question the identity of skates collected in the waters off the Falkland Islands previously identified as Zearaja chilensis. NADH2 sequence data indicate that these specimens are not conspecific with those currently referred to as Z chilensis from Chile and, in fact, represent a novel cryptic species. This study aimed to investigate this hypothesis based on morphological comparisons of specimens from the coasts of both western and eastern South America. In total, 50 specimens from Chile and 41 specimens from the Falkland Islands were collected and examined; morphometric data were generated for a subset of specimens from both areas. NADH2 sequence data were generated for a total of 19 specimens from both areas, as well as specimens of Z nasuta from New Zealand, D. pullopunctatus from South Africa, D. oxyrinchus from the Azores, Okamejei hollandi, and O. cairae from Borneo, and O. kenojei from Japan. Based on morphological and molecular analyses, Zearaja is synonymized with Dipturus and species assigned to the former genus are transferred to the latter genus. A neotype is designated for D. chilensis and this species is redescribed. Dipturus lamillai sp. nov. is described based on specimens from the Falkland Islands. Comparison of our NADH2 data with data for mitochondrial genomes generated from tissue samples taken from two specimens originally identified as Z chilensis, indicate that, while the sample from Chile came from a specimen of D. chilensis, that from the skate steak obtained from a restaurant in Korea actually came from a specimen of D. lamillai sp. nov. This emphasizes the importance of confirming both the provenance and identity of specimens from which sequence data are generated and submitted to GenBank if misidentifications are to be avoided.

In this study, 44 Beauveria isolates from the state of Colima, Mexico harbored in the "Coleccion de Hongos EntomopatOgenos" of the "Centro Nacional de Referencia de Control Biologico" and from different substrates, insect-hosts, and localities were characterized with molecular markers. All isolates were identified using a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) and nuclear intergenic Bloc region. Forty-three isolates were identified as B. bassiana and grouped into two sub-clades, i.e., AFNEO_1 (n = 22; previously defined as a Glade with African and Neotropical origin) and Bb Glade (n = 21; closely associated with ex-type strain ARSEF 1564), and one isolate was identified as B. pseudobassiana. The fixation index (F-ST = 0.493) established the genetic differentiation between AFNEO_1 and Bb Glades. High genotype richness and genetic diversity of AFNEO_1 and Bb clades were revealed in sequence analysis of Bloc region and SSR genotyping. Moreover, the AFNEO_1 and Bb clades were confirmed as two independent clonally structured assemblages. Finally, the AMOVA detected no significant association between any combination of substrate, insect-host or geographical origin. High genetic variation of B. bassiana in Colima, Mexico could suggest a functional diversity among isolates that may include those effective against a specific insect pest.

Most reports of infection by Marteilia spp. are from Europe, while a new species of Marteilia was identified recently in Japan. Here, we report a previously unidentified species in the genus Marteilia from digestive diverticula of Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum from the south coast of Korea. Prevalence of the parasite was low, 0.5-3.3% in the study sites. We characterized this species using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and analyzed the 18S rDNA sequence. Light microscopy revealed the sporulation process from uninucleated stage to spore in the epithelial tissues of the digestive gland. TEM revealed that the parasites produced four secondary cells containing four tri-cellular spores. An electron-dense haplosporosome-like structure and striated inclusions were evident in the spore and the primary cells, respectively, while refringent granules were rarely observed in the secondary cells. Phylogenetic analyses of the 18S rDNA sequence placed this isolate in the genus Marteilia, although it is not identical to other known species in the genus. Based on morphological and molecular characters, we describe this species as Marteilia tapetis sp. nov., the second Marteilia species reported parasitizing Manila clams in Asian waters.

The objectives of the current study were to specifically describe the morphology and determine for the first time the phylogenetic position of Glossidium pedatum and Orientocreadium batrachoides. Examination of G. pedatum using conventional light and scanning microscopy techniques revealed undescribed features related to the digestive system, the presence of papillae-like lateral lappets, and terminal lobes covered with backwardly directed spines. Orientocreadium batrachoides revealed a pharynx that is four lobed anteriorly. Both the large (28S) and small (18S) subunits of the ribosomal genome, analysed through Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood, were used to genetically characterise these species. Phylogenies indicate that G. pedatum does not fit well into any known family within the Plagiorchioidea, as currently indicated in various systematic structures based on morphology. However, G. pedatum was closely related to Haematoloechidae according to analyses of 18S and 28S rDNA. Based on 28S rDNA, O. batrachoides formed a well-supported clade with Orientocreadium pseudobagri within the family Orientocreadiidae. In turn, Orientocreadiidae is closely related to Leptophallidae. The current study provides essential information that could be helpful to assign the family for Glossidium in future studies. Characterisation of life-cycle stages may be necessary to fully elucidate the systematic position of G. pedatum.

In this paper we review the genus based on examination of six species from Slovakia, namely H. ambigua sp. nov., H. collina (Huhta & Karg, 2010), H. flexuosa (Michael, 1891) comb. nov., H. isotricha Kolenati, 1858, H. montana (Berlese, 1904) and H. oophila (Wasmann, 1897). We also carried out a careful study of the published work on Holostaspis and related genera, and examined types in the Berlese Acaroteca and other collections. Seven species pre- viously described under the names Hypoaspis (Holostaspis) and Holostaspis are transferred to other genera H. (H.) brev- identis Karg, 1978 = Pseudoparasitus brevidentis (Karg, 1978) comb. nov., H. (H.) chelaris Teng, Zhang & Cui, 1992 = Euandrolaelaps chelaris (Teng, Zhang & Cui, 1992) comb. nov., H. (H.) metapodalii Karg, 1978 = Gymnolaelaps metapodalii (Karg, 1978) comb. nov., H. mooni Keum, Jung & Joharchi, 2017 = Hypoaspisella mooni (Keum, Jung & Joharchi, 2017) comb. nov., H. (H.) serpentis Karg, 1979 = Hypoaspisella serpentis (Karg, 1979) comb. nov., H. (H.) tridentata Karg, 1979 = Gymnolaelaps tridentatus (Karg, 1979) comb. nov., and Holostaspis (Holostaspis) marginedentatus Trdgardh, 1910 is transferred to Glyptholaspis (Macrochelidae). Based on features of the type specimens (deposited at the Berlese Collection in Florence), the morphological concept of Myrmonyssus (Laelaspulus) acuminatus Berlese, 1903 is revised and the systematic status of the subgenus is re-evaluated. The monobasic Laelaspulus Berlese, 1904 is now removed from synonymy with Myrmozercon Berlese, 1902 and newly considered as a junior synonym of Holostaspis. Another four revised species, originally classified in Laelaps Koch, Myrmozercon Berlese or Hypoaspis Canestrini, are transferred into Holostaspis L. flexuosa Michael, 1891 = Holostaspis flexuosa (Michael, 1891) comb. nov., M. irani- cus Babaeian & Nemati, 2014 = Holostaspis iranica (Babaeian & Nemati, 2014) comb. nov., M. michaeli Joharchi, 2013 = Holostaspis michaeli (Joharchi, 2013) comb. nov., and H. submontana Bai, Gu & Chen, 1994 = Holostaspis submontana (Bai, Gu & Chen, 1994) comb. nov.

J	Perreau, M				Perreau, Michel			Phylogeny of Bathysciotina Gueorguiev, 1974, based on morphology with a special emphasis to Italian genera and with the description of a new species of Halbherria (Coleoptera Leiodidae Cholevinae Leptodirini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Halbherria daffneri; Leptodirini; Cholevinae; Leiodidae; Coleoptera		The discovery of the new species Halbherria daffneri Perreau, n. sp., a troglobitic species with pholeuonid body shape, in the high altitude karst system of Piani Eterni in southern Dolomites (northern Italy) is taken as an opportunity for a morphological investigation of the phylogeny of Bathysciotina with a special emphasis to the Italian genera. The monophyly of the set of Italian genera, (Aphaotus, Halbherria, Lessiniella, Neobathyscia, Sinuicollia) is confidently supported, with Neobathysica as the sister group of the four other genera. However the monophyly of the subtribe Bathysciotina is not significantly supported and the genus Sphaerobathyscia should clearly be excluded from the subtribe. The subgenus Albanella of the genus Speonesiotes is raised to genus rank.

O.			A new species of Oxymycterus (Rodentia: Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae) from a transitional area of Cerrado - Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY			English	Article						acid phosphatase type V; Akodontini; Cerrado; cytochrome b; Oxymycterus delator	ARAUCARIA FOREST; AKODON RODENTIA; SOUTH-AMERICA; SMALL MAMMALS; ARBOREAL RAT; SWAMP RAT; GENUS; SYSTEMATICS; TRIBE; DIVERSIFICATION	We describe a new species of the cricetid rodent Oxymycterus (Sigmodontinae), which inhabits a transitional area between the southern Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest in south-southeastern Brazil. Compared to other Oxymycterus, the new species is large-sized with a tawny-brown pelage coloration. The new species could be differentiated from other Oxymycterus species by a combination of cranial characteristics that includes markedly large and inflated auditory bulla; a narrow rostrum and large incisive foramen, with the posterior extremity reaching the posterior region of the M1 protocone or hypoflexus; a wide parapterygoid fossa; the presence of a foramen ovale in the posterior region of the parapterygoid plate; and a thin hamular process of the squamosal. Bayesian analysis based on the mitochondrial and nuclear genes (cytochrome-b and acid phosphatase type V-Intron 2, respectively) recovered from the Oxymycterus sp. nov. showed it to be phylogenetically closely related to O. amazonicus and O. delator, all three species associated with open vegetation. The lineage leading to this clade likely emerged around 1.14 million years ago during the Early-Middle Pleistocene. Genetic distances between the new taxa and these two species calculated from comparison of cytochrome-b sequences are 3.7% and 4.1%, respectively. Currently, Oxymycterus sp. nov. is known from only two unprotected sites, with the type locality inserted in an area under the process of conurbation. Our study raises the number of living species in the genus to 16.	[Pecanha, Willian Thomaz; Jorge Ribas, Luiz Eduardo; Goncalves, Gislene Lopes; de Freitas, Thales R.
