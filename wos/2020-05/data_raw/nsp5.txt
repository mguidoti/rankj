Molecular phylogeny of neodalyellid flatworms (Rhabdocoela), including three new species from British Columbia	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						character evolution; flatworms; meiofauna; molecular phylogeny; Platyhelminthes	NORTH-SEA; SP-N; PLATYHELMINTHES; TURBELLARIANS; HOLOTHURIANS; MEIOFAUNA	Rhabdocoel flatworms are abundant members of marine meiofaunal communities worldwide, contributing to a reservoir of biodiversity that thrives in sediments and on macroalgae. Yet, they are relatively understudied due to bias in meiofaunal collection techniques, time-intensive identification and a lack of taxonomic expertise. Here, sampling of intertidal habitats in British Columbia, Canada, was undertaken to enhance our understanding of rhabdocoel diversity in this region. Six species of neodalyellid rhabdocoel were discovered and characterized with DNA sequence and morphological data: Pogaina paranygulgus, Anoplodium hymanae, Baicalellia pusilla n. comb., B. solaris n. sp., B. daftpunka n. sp. and Tamanawas kalipis n. g., n. sp. The latter three species are new to science. A phylogenetic analysis of neodalyellid rhabdocoels, inferred from 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of 39 taxa, provided further insight into their interrelationships, trait evolution and systematics, including the recognition of a new genus, Tamanawas, and the suppression of Canetellia and Coronopharynx.

Indopacifica, a new genus of Selenoribatidae, is described from Thailand and Malaysia, with two new species, Indopacifica pantai n. sp. and Indopacifica parva n. sp. The genus is characterized by the unique combination of following characters: lacking lamellar ridges, incomplete dorsosejugal suture, fourteen pairs of notogastral setae, and presence of epimeral foveae. A phylogenetic reconstruction based on 18S ribosomal RNA sequences clearly confirms the distinctness of the new genus Indopacifica and places it close to the genus Rhizophobates. The lack of molecular genetic data of possible relatives impedes a clear assessment, and hence, we emphasize the need for further combined approaches using morphological and molecular genetic sequence data. All species show wide distribution areas within this geographic region suggesting that these taxa are good dispersers despite their minute size and wingless body. Molecular genetic data demonstrate recent gene flow between far distant populations of I. pantai n. sp. from the coasts of Thailand and two islands of Malaysia and hence confirm this assumption. The seasonally changing surface currents within this geographic area may favor hydrochorous dispersal and hence genetic exchange. Nevertheless, morphometric data show a slight trend to morphological divergence among the studied populations, whereas this variation is suggested to be a result of genetic drift but also of habitat differences in one population of Alismobates pseudoreticulatus.

One of the key aspects of any comparative study is to have a robust, comprehensive phylogeny, and an updated taxonomy. Recently, the Infraorder Gekkota has been the subject of several phylogenetic analyses and taxonomic revisions at different levels. Despite all these phylogenetic and taxonomic advances, there are still some groups whose systematics and taxonomy remain highly problematic. Maybe one of the most poorly resolved groups in spite of decades of intensive research by many herpetologists are the so-called Palearctic naked-toed geckos of the family Gekkonidae. This group of nocturnal geckos distributed from Mauritania across North Africa, Arabia, southwestern and central Asia to northern India, western China and southern Mongolia is characterized by the synapomorphy of lack of adhesive subdigital pads. Within the Palearctic naked-toed geckos, the Saharo-Arabian clade comprised by the genera Pseudoceramodactylus, Stenodactylus, and Tropiocolotes is the clade with the largest distribution range. At the same time, it is one of the problematic groups, presenting poorly supported phylogenetic relationships, with the genus Tropiocolotes being recovered non-monophyletic in all analyses despite its morphological uniformity. To reassess the phylogeny of the Palearctic naked-toed geckos with a special interest in the systematics of Tropiocolotes, we assembled a dataset comprising 298 gecko specimens from 283 different species (including all Tropiocolotes species but one) belonging to 122 of a total of 124 described gecko genera. This dataset included the nuclear c-mos, ACM4, RAG1, RAG2, and PDC and the mitochondrial ND2 gene. To further investigate the relationships within Tropiocolotes and to revise the systematics of the south Arabian endemic species Tropiocolotes scorteccii, we used an integrative approach including information from the nuclear MC1R and c-mos, the mitochondrial 12S, 16S, cytb genes, and morphological data from nine of the 10 described Tropiocolotes species. The phylogenetic analyses of the Gekkota dataset recovered a similar topology for the Palearctic naked-toed geckos to previous studies, but in this case, Tropiocolotes was recovered monophyletic in all analyses, with high support in two of them. The results of the analyses of three datasets specifically assembled to test the effect of both gene sampling and taxon sampling in the monophyly of Tropiocolotes, and the internal relationships of the Palearctic naked-toed geckos clearly showed that both the number and kind of characters (nuclear or mitochondrial data) and the number of taxa played a fundamental role in recovering the correct phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic analyses within Tropiocolotes suggested the existence of high levels of undescribed diversity in the south Arabian T. scorteccii, including a new genetically and morphologically distinct species endemic to Oman (Tropiocolotes confusus sp. nov.). Our study using a large dataset, including several loci and a dense taxon sampling within Gekkota and especially within Tropiocolotes, has proved a valuable strategy to address the monophyly of Tropiocolotes and the relationships within the Saharo-Arabian Palearctic naked-toed geckos. The integrative systematic approach including several samples of south Arabian T. scorteccii based on many years of fieldwork has, once more, uncovered a new species endemic to this region. This highlights the importance of this area of Arabia as a reservoir of reptile endemicity and biodiversity, which is likely linked to the high degree of habitat heterogeneity and the effect of the monsoons. Obviously, based on this and previously published evidence, south Arabia represents an area with still high levels of undiscovered diversity.

It is one of the most economically important tribes in Tephritidae harbouring several species of quarantine concern across the world. We describe two new species of Bactrocera Macquart, B. (Parazeugodacus) conica David & Ramani, sp. n. & B. (B.) prabhui David, sp. n. from India. Postabdominal structures of males and/or females of 23 species of Bactrocera, 16 species of Zeugodacus and 8 species of Dacus from India are illustrated and described for the first time, which revealed similarities between Dacus and Zeugodacus with respect to epandrial shape and praeputium patterning. Bactrocera is unique in possessing oval shaped epandrium and an unpatterned praeputium. An analysis of phylogenetic relationships between three genera of the tribe Dacini from India based on morphological characters has been attempted for the first time. Cladistic analysis employing 51 characters of 62 species in Dacini, with seven species as outgroups revealed the monophyly of Dacini, Bactrocera and Dacus with supporting nonhomplasious synapomorphies. Ichneumonopsis Hardy, often included in the Gastrozonini, does not possess any synapomorphies of Dacini, eventhough it appeared at the base of the Dacini Glade. Zeugodacus was retrieved as a monophyletic sister-group to Dacus based solely on a single homoplasious host plant character, with weak statistcal support.	[David, K.

J	Cruz, PV; Hamada, N				Cruz, Paulo Vilela; Hamada, Neusa			A new species of Harpagobaetis Mol, with amended diagnosis of the genus, and new considerations on predatory species of Baetidae (Ephemeroptera) from South America	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						aquatic insects; conservation; Parque Nacional dos Campos Amazonicos; Brazil	MINNOW MAYFLIES EPHEMEROPTERA; INSECTA EPHEMEROPTERA; GENERA; SYSTEMATICS; COMPLEX	A remarkable new predatory species of Baetidae was collected in a relict patch of Amazonian savanna in Brazil. The feeding habit of the nymph of this new species is very rare in mayflies. Baetidae is composed of more than 900 species, but only 12 are considered to be predators; in South America, the only species recognized as a predator is Harpagobaetis gulosas Mol 1986. The objectives of this study are to describe Harpagobaetis brigada sp. nov., based on nymphs and to amend the diagnosis of the genus. The predatory habit of the nymphs of the new species was confirmed by gut-content analysis and by direct observations of behavior. Based on similar morphological adaptations, we hypothesized that Adebrotus lugoi Salles, 2010 possesses predatory habit. Harpagobaetis brigada sp. nov. can be classified as psammophilous, inhabiting a threatened stream in a relict patch of savanna in southern Amazonia. Based on these characteristics, we recommend evaluation of this new species to identify its conservation status and to contribute to the assessment of the state of conservation of the Brazilian fauna.

Gyrodactylus anaspidus n. sp. is described from the armored-catfish, Pareiorhaphis parmula (Loricariidae) and Gyrodactylus polyadenus n. sp. is described from the cascarudo, Callichthys callichthys (Callichthyidae). The new species differ from previously described neotropical species of Gyrodactylus by the relative morphology of their haptoral hard structures and male copulatory organ (MCO). Gyrodactylus anaspidus n. sp. has a superficial bar without a shield and an MCO with one row of spinelets (9-11 spinelets). Gyrodactylus polyadenus n. sp. presents a shield associated to a superficial bar, a deep bar with narrow extremities connected to the anchors, a subrectangular hooklet with a short point, and an MCO with one row of six spinelets. We also report that G anaspidus n. sp. co-occurs with oviparous species of Gyrodactylidae on their respective loricariid hosts.

J	Halse, SA; Martens, K				Halse, Stuart A.; Martens, Koen			Four new genera and five new species of 'Heterocypris' from Western Australia (Crustacea, Ostracoda, Cyprinotinae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Taxonomy; evolution; Ostracoda; aquatic biodiversity; Western Australia	CYPRIDIDAE; DIVERSITY; ISLANDS	Five new species in four new genera from Western Australia are described. All species have valve characters that are reminiscent of the genus Heterocypris Claus, 1892 and also have similar valve outlines, with highly arched valves. However, all species have a hemipenis morphology that is totally different from the typical form in Heterocypris. In Patcypris gen. nov. (with type species P outback gen. et sp. nov.), the lateral lobe is large and shaped as a pickaxe, while the medial lobe is divided into two distal lobes. Trilocypris gen. nov. (with type species T. horwitzi gen. et sp. nov.) is characterised by a hemipenis that has three, instead of two, distal lobes. In Bilocypris gen. nov. (with type species B. fortescuensis gen. et sp. nov. and a second species, B. mandoraensis gen. et sp. nov.), the lateral lobe of the hemipenis is spatulate, rather than boot-shaped, and the medial lobe is bilobed. Bilicypris gen. nov. (with type species B. davisae gen. et sp. nov.) has a large and sub-rectangular lateral lobe and a pointed medial lobe. We discuss the taxonomic value of the traditional and new morphological characters and speculate that the diversity of this cluster of genera and species may be greater than currently known.

Amblypygids of Timor-Leste: first records of the order from the country with the description of a remarkable new species of Sarax (Arachnida, Amblypygi, Charinidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						cave; tailless whip scorpions; troglobiont; Wallacea	CHARONTIDAE; PHRYNUS; SIMON; CAVE	The whip spider genus Sarax Simon, 1892 is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia and part of the Indo-Malayan region. The genus is recorded from several Indonesian islands, but no species are known from inside the area that comprises the biogeographical region of Wallacea, despite being recorded from both sides of the area. An expedition to survey the biology of caves in Timor-Leste (formerly East-Timor) discovered populations of amblypygids living underground and including a remarkable new species of Sarax, S. timorensis sp. n., the first Amblypygi known from the island of Timor. The new species is here described bears the unique character state of two pairs of lateral eyes, instead of three or none as in all other living species of Amblypygi, and expands the biogeographic range of the genus. New records of amblypygids are give n for two caves in Timor-Leste. A detailed description and a discussion of its distribution and the species characters are also provided.

Triatoma huehuetenanguensis sp. n. is closely related to T. dimidiata (Latreille, 1811), with the following main morphological differences: lighter color; smaller overall size, including head length; and width and length of the pronotum. Natural Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909) infection, coupled with its presence in domestic habitats, makes this species a potentially important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in Guatemala.

A new species, Schizotheca galaica sp. nov., is described. Eleven species are newly recorded in Galicia: Aetea longicollis, Parellisina curvirostris, Copidozoum planum, Glabrilaria corbula, Haplopoma sciaphilum, Schizomavella (Schizomavella) mamillata, Fenestrulina asturiasensis, Fenestrulina barrosoi, Buffonellaria muriella, Schizotheca divisa and Dentiporella saldanhai; two of them (B. muriella and S. divisa) are also reported for the first time in Iberian waters; four others (Antarctothoa galaica, F. asturiasensis, F. barrosoi and D. saldanhai) are reported for the first time since their original descriptions, and SEM images of A. longicollis and F. asturiasensis are provided for the first time. Moreover, the range of geographical distribution of some species is expanded: the record of S. divisa is the southernmost to date, while the records of S. mamillata, F. barrosoi and D. saldanhai are the most northerly to date. The presence of other four species in Galician waters is confirmed and we document the permanence and range extension of two species recently introduced into our waters (Tricellaria inopinata and A. galaica).

Metroperiella populations from the Mediterranean Sea, which have hitherto been regarded as conspecific with Metroperiella lepralioides, are introduced as a new species, Metroperiella mesogeia sp. nov. Accordingly, the geographic distribution of M. lepralioides is restricted to its type locality, the Azores Archipelago (central North Atlantic). Another species, Metroperiella porellidesia sp. nov., which occurs sympatrically with M. lepralioides, is also newly described.

The discovery of a representative of the tropical mayfly genus Bungona in the Middle East is rather unexpected. The new species shows all the main morphological characters of the subgenus Chopralla, which has its closest related species occurring in southeastern Asia. Barcoding clearly indicated that the new species represents an independent lineage isolated for a very long time from other members of the complex. The claw is equipped with two rows of three or four flattened denticles. This condition is a unique feature of Bungona (Chopralla) pontica sp. n. among West Palaearctic mayfly species. Within the subgenus Chopralla, the species can be identified by the presence of a simple, not bifid right prostheca (also present only in Bungona (Chopralla) liebenauae (Soldan, Braasch & Muu, 1987)), the shape of the labial palp, and the absence of protuberances on pronotum.

The new species differs from other South American amphisbaenids by the folllowing combination of characters: (1) snout rounded in dorsal view and slightly convex in lateral view; (2) two precloacal pores; (3) 161-176 dorsal half-annuli; and (4) 12-15 tail annuli. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis retrieved a monophyletic Amphisbaena silvestrii group, with A. silvestrii positioned as the sister-group of a Glade formed by Amphisbaena anaemariae and the new species described herein. Members of the A. silvestrii group including A. neglecta and A. crisae not added in our phylogenetic analysis are characterized by a relatively small body, two precloacal pores, body coloration with dark and light areas, and lack of specializations on the cephalic or caudal shields. We present a key for two-pored species of Amphisbaena.

All four species show a typical dark blue dorsal pigmentation pattern, which is unique to the genus. This pigment forms a broad longitudinal line in P. shenda n. sp. and P. sinensis n. sp., shows an additional transverse band at the level of the pharynx in P. smeetsae n. sp. and forms a Y-shaped pattern in P isoldeae n. sp. The four species can also be distinguished from each other and their congeners by the detailed morphology of the hard parts of the male system, which in all cases consists of an L-shaped (P. shenda n. sp., P. isoldeae n. sp) or slightly-curved (P. smeetsae n. sp., P. sinensis n. sp.) prostate stylet type II and a prostate stylet type III, which consists of three plates: a basal plate from which two longer plates depart, each with a distal serrated rim. A phylogenetic analysis based on 18S and 285-rDNA data indicates that Paraustrorhynchus is a monophyletic taxon within Polycystidinae, with Alcha evelinae as the sister group.

Nearly 3000 described species from 269 families are recorded in the country, representing a 56% increase from the 1917 species reported by Lindquist et al. (1979). An additional 42 families are known from Canada only from material identified to family- or genus-level. Of the total 311 families known in Canada, 69 are newly recorded since 1979, excluding apparent new records due solely to classification changes. This substantial progress is most evident in Oribatida and Hydrachnidia, for which many regional checklists and family-level revisions have been published. Except for recent taxonomic leaps in a few other groups, particularly of symbiotic mites (Astigmata: feather mites; Mesostigmats: Rhinonyssidae), knowledge remains limited for most other taxa, for which most species records are unpublished and may require verification. Taxonomic revisions are greatly needed for a large majority families in Canada. Based in part on species recorded in adjacent areas of the USA and on hosts known to be present here, we conservatively estimate that nearly 10,000 species of mites occur in Canada, but the actual number could be 15,000 or more. This means that at least 70% of Canada's mite fauna is yet unrecorded. Much work also remains to match existing molecular data with species names, as less than 10% of the similar to 7500 Barcode Index Numbers for Canadian mites in the Barcode of Life Database are associated with named species. Understudied hosts and terrestrial and aquatic habitats require investigation across Canada to uncover new species and to clarify geographic and ecological distributions of known species.

There are 474 described extant Collembola species known from Canada, a significant change compared to the 520 species estimated to occur in Canada in 1979 (Richards 1979) and the 341 reported in the most recent national checklist (Skidmore 1993). Given the number of indeterminate or cryptic species records, the dearth of sampling in many regions, and the growing use of genetic biodiversity assessment methods such as Barcode Index Numbers, we estimate the total diversity of Collembola in Canada to be approximately 675 species. Advances in Collembola systematics and Canadian research are discussed.

The sponge is apricot-coloured with small sulphur-yellow spots, comprised of one or more conical or cylindrical massive bases, each with a single apical osculum. Long, more or less branched digitiform ramifications emerge from these bases, with one or two oscula in high position. The ectosomal skeleton consists of bundles of interwoven mycalostyles forming a triangular or polygonal tangential reticulation. The choanosomal skeleton shows longitudinal axial tracts, with fan-like feathered plurispicular bundles perpendicular to the surface of the sponge. It is characterized by presenting only mycalostyles as megascleres and three categories of palmate anisochelae as microscleres, the larger forming rosettes, microxeas in dragmata and thin raphides, ornamented at both ends by a fine spine, and grouped in numerous trichodragmata clustered in the subectosomal yellow spots.

Hippolyte cedrici sp. nov., from Principe and Sao Tome, can be distinguished from both the related H. holthuisi Zariquey Alvarez, 1953 and H. varians Leach, 1814 on the basis of rostral dentition, as well as meristics of the ambulatory pereiopods. Hippolyte karenae sp. nov., from St. Helena, is morphologically similar to H. coerulescens (Fabricius, 1775) and H. obliquimanus Dana, 1852, by having a well-developed tooth on the outer angle of the first peduncular article of the antennula. It differs from these species, amongst other characters, primarily in the armature of the ambulatory dactyli. Specimens were collected from hydrozoan, antipatharian and alcyonarian cnidarians.

This study represents the first record of peculiar dancing behaviour related to search for food and feeding among Collembola. The new species is molecularly and morphologically assigned to the European Lepidocyrtus lignorum-group. Sequences of COXII and EF- 1 alpha genes, chaetotaxy and behaviour clearly help to differentiate the new species from the other species in the group.

A new species of algal-boring limnoriid is here described. Limnoria furca sp. nov. was collected from the holdfasts of Eisenia bicyclis on the Oki Islands and the Sea of Japan coast of Honshu and Kyushu Islands, Japan. L. furca sp. nov. is diagnosed morphologically by lacking a mandibular palp, faint subparallel carinae on the pleotelson, faint Y-shaped carinae on pereonite 5, the bifid lacinia mobilis of right mandible and the shapes of the secondary unguis on the pereopods. Similar species, L. segnoides Menzies, 1957 and L. nagatai Nunomura, 2012, are redescribed on the basis of the holotypes.

Redescription and new records of a poorly known leucosiid crab, Pseudophilyra punctulata Chen & Ng, 2003, and description of a new species of Pseudophilyra from Japan (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Pseudophilyra parilis; Pseudophilyra tridentata; Thailand; Philippines; Ryukyu Islands		A poorly known leucosiid crab, Pseudophilyra punctulata Chen & Ng, 2003, originally described on the basis of an immature male holotype and an immature female paratype from Singapore, is rediscovered and rediagnosed on the basis of material from Thailand, the Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands (Japan). In addition, a new species closely related to P. punctulata, P. parilis, is described and illustrated on the basis of material from Mie Prefecture, Honshu mainland of Japan. The new species is distinguished from P. punctulata by the coarser granules bordering the lateral carapace margins and the different shape of the gonopods. Pseudophilyra tridentata Miers, 1879, is also compared with P. punctulata and P. parilis n. sp. because of the close similarities in the overall morphology of the carapace and appendages, but can easily be differentiated by the smoother carapace and thoracic sternum surface, different shape of the carapace and the stouter cheliped palm. It is possible that previous records of P. tridentata outside Japan might contain more than one species.

(Zingiberaceae), two new species of Rhogadopsis Brethes (Braconidae: Opiinae) viz., R. gratia Gupta & van Achterberg, sp. n. and R. macrusa Gupta & van Achterberg, sp. n. were reared as solitary larval-pupal parasitoids of Merochlorops in the stems of H. gardnerianum. Interestingly, both wasp species have very different ovipositor lengths, in addition to other characters for species delimitation. Perhaps parasitism by the respective wasp species depends on the thickness of the stem harbouring the chloropid larvae. In the present study, both these new species of wasps are described and illustrated, together with notes on their biology. For the first time the genus Rhogadopsis has been found associated with Chloropidae; earlier records concern Agromyzidae.	[Gupta, Ankita; Ballal, Chandish R.; Rajeshwari, S.

In accordance with the new molecular phylogenies, the traditional Facelinidae is paraphyletic. Herein is presented the phylogenetic placement of true Facelinidae s. str., including the first molecular data for F.auriculata(Muller, 1776), type species of the genus Facelina Alder & Hancock, 1855. The taxonomic history of F.auriculata is reviewed. The genus Milli is related to the Cade Facelinidae s. str., but shows disparate morphological traits. Two new species of the genus Myja, M. karin sp. n., and M. hyotan sp. n., arc described from the Pacific waters of Japan (middle Honshu), and M. cf. longicornis Bergh, 1896 is investigated from Thailand. According to molecular analysis and review of available morphological information, the genus Myja contains more hidden diversity. The family-level relationship within aeolidacean nudibranchs with emphasis on the family Facelinidae is outlined. The problem of the relationship between Facelinidae Bergh, 1889 and Glaucidae Gray, 1827 is discussed. The family Glaucidae has precedence over Facelinidae and is phylogenetically related to the core group of Facelinidae s. str., but has a profoundly modified aberrant external morphology, thus making a purely molecular-based approach to the taxonomy an unsatisfactory solution. To accommodate recently discovered hidden diversity within glaucids, the genus Glaucilla Bergh, 1861 is restored. The family Facelinidae s. str. is separate from, and not closely related to, a clade containing the genera Dondice Marcus, 1958, Godiva MacNae 1954, Hermissenda Bergh, 1879, and Phyllodesmium Ehrenberg, 1831 (= Myrrhine Bergh, 1905). The oldest valid available name for the separate ex-facelinid paraphyletic clade that contains several facelinid genera is Myrrhinidae Bergh, 1905, and resurrection of this family name under provision of the ICZN article 40.1 can preliminarily solve the problem of paraphyly of the traditional Facelinidae. "Facelinidae" s. l. needs to be further divided into several separate families, pending further study.

J	Perissinotto, R				Perissinotto, Renzo			Description of Callophylla macrocephala sp. n. from southern Tanzania	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Afrotropical region; Callophylla; Cetoniinae; new species; Tanzania		A male cetoniine specimen from the old Schurhoff collection currently deposited in the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History (Pretoria, South Africa), was recently submitted for identification and has been found to represent a yet undescribed species of the poorly-known genus Callophylla Moser, 1916. The species is named C. macrocephala sp. n., in recognition of its wider than average head, particularly at the level of the clypeus, and originates from the southern Tanzanian highlands, near the Tanzania-Zambia border town of Nakonde. This brings the total number of species now known for this genus to four, two from West Africa and two from East-Central Africa. All species were described on the basis of a male only, or this and a few extra specimens. The female is only known for the two West African species, C. costata Moser, 1916 and C. lamottei Antoine, 2007. A dichotomous key for the identification of the species of this genus is presented for the first time. It is suggested that the genus may be constituted of high altitude specialists, with a short period of activity and no ability to feed at the adult stage.

The pholcid spiders of Sri Lanka (Araneae: Pholcidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Sri Lanka; spiders; Pholcidae; diversity; endemism	INDIAN SUBCONTINENT; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ENDEMISM; TAXONOMY	As part of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot, Sri Lanka harbors a rich and diverse fauna, especially in the perhumid southwestern part of the island. However, many invertebrate groups such as spiders continue to be poorly studied. The present paper reviews our knowledge about Pholcidae, a family of spiders that is well represented in Sri Lanka, both by numerous (10) introduced species and by a rich native fauna in five genera (described native Sri Lankan species in parentheses): Belisana Thorell, 1898 (6), Leptopholcus Simon, 1893 (1), Pholcus Walckenaer, 1805 (4), Tissahamia Huber, 2018 (4), and Wanniyala Huber & Benjamin, 2005 (9). Fourteen species are newly described: Belisana minneriya sp. n., B. badulla sp. n., B. gowindahela sp. n.; Pholcus metta sp. n., P puranappui sp. n., P uva sp. n.; Tissahamia karuna sp. n.; Wanniyala mudita sp. n., W orientalis sp. n., W upekkha sp. n., W ohiya sp. n., W viharekele sp. n., W mapalena sp. n., and W labugama sp. n.. All new species are described from males and females. New Sri Lankan records are given for 16 previously described species. Distribution data suggest that most or all of the 24 native species might be endemic to Sri Lanka, but the Indian pholcid fauna remains almost entirely unknown.

The new species can be distinguished from other Caucasiron by a unique combination of several diagnostic characters: the presence of a rounded hypodermal medial femur spot, colouration of abdominal terga and sterna, narrow gill plate VII, fine hair-like setae on the surface of abdominal terga, and absence of postero-lateral projections on tergum X. In addition to morphological analysis, two single-locus analytical approaches are employed for delimiting the new species using COI sequences (Automatic Bar-code Gap Discovery, ABGD; and General Mixed Yule Coalescent Model, GMYC). Both approaches unambiguously recognized E. (C.) turcicus sp. nov. as a distinct species. Our molecular dataset contains all Caucasiron species occurring in the Caucasus and the delimitation of individual species mostly follows the morphologically defined species. This study confirms the suitability of the GMYC approach for species delimitation within Caucasiron.

Allobates carajas sp. nov. is distinguished from similar congeneric species by the combination of the following characters: body-size range (snout-to-vent length 16.5-19.1 mm), dorsal color pattern with a dark brown hourglass-shaped mark, by the absence of a pale dorsolateral stripe and presence of a pale ventrolateral stripe, absence of a pale paracloacal mark, by overall bright yellow ventral colors of live male and female specimens, and by the posterior labium of tadpoles, with a single row of pyramidal papillae medially. The advertisement call of the new species is highly variable, with four possible temporal arrangements of notes (continuous emission of notes separated by regular silent intervals, continuous emission of notes separated by irregular silent intervals, emission of discrete note trills, and sporadic emission of single notes). Duration of notes range between 0.020-0.060 s, and the dominant frequency of notes range from 4.75 to 5.38 kHz. The new species is currently known only from forested habitats within Floresta Nacional de Carajas.

J	Viraktamath, CA; Webb, MD				Viraktamath, C. A.; Webb, M. D.			Revision of the bamboo leafhopper tribe Mukariini (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Deltocephalinae) from the Indian subcontinent with description of new genera and species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Mukariinae; Buloria; Crispina; Myittana; bamboo; morphology	GENUS	Leafhopper genera and species of the tribe Mukariini from the Indian subcontinent are revised. Nine genera and 22 species including two new genera, one new subgenus and 12 new species are dealt with. The new taxa described are Aalinga gen. nov. with its type species Aalinga brunoflava sp. nov. (India: Andaman Islands), Buloria indica sp. nov. (India: Karnataka). Buloria zeylanica sp. nov. (Sri Lanka), Flatfronta bella sp. nov. (India: Karnataka; Bangladesh), Mohunia bifurcata sp. nov. (Myanmar), Mukaria omani sp. nov. (India: Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh), Mukaria vakra sp. nov. (India: Karnataka), Mukariella gen. nov. with its type species Mukariella daii sp. nov. (India: Manipur), Myittana (Benglebra) cornuta sp. nov. (India: Karnataka), Myittana (Myittana) distincta sp. nov. (India: Karnataka), Myittana (Savasa) subgen. nov. with its type species Myittana (Savasa) constricta sp. nov. (India: Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand) and Scaphotettix arcuatus sp. nov. (India: West Bengal, Meghalaya, Mizoram). Genera Buloria Distant (new placement), Crispina Distant (new placement) and Myittana Distant (new placement) are placed in the tribe Mukariini. Genus Mohunia is redefined based on the study of its type species. Benglebra Mahmood & Ahmed 1969 is synonymised with Myittana Distant 1908 and considered as its subgenus. Myittana (Benglebra) alami (Mahmood & Ahmed) comb. nov., Myittana (Savasa) bipunctata (Mahmood & Ahmed) comb. nov.. Myittana (Benglebra) introspina (Chen & Yang 2007) comb. nov. and Mukariella bambusana (Li & Chen) comb. nov. are proposed; the first two species were earlier placed in the genus Benglebra, the third species in the genus Mohunia and the fourth in the genus Mukaria. Genera Flatfronta Chen & Li and Myittana are new records for India and Scaphotettix striata Dai & Zhang is a new record for the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. All taxa dealt with are described and illustrated and keys for genera and their species are also given.	[Viraktamath, C. A.] Univ Agr Sci, GKVK, Dept Entomol, Bengaluru 560065, India; [Webb, M.

J	Huber, BA; Carvalho, LS				Huber, Bernhard A.; Carvalho, Leonardo S.			Filling the gaps: descriptions of unnamed species included in the latest molecular phylogeny of Pholcidae (Araneae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						taxonomy; Pholcidae; Brazil; Oman; Indonesia	SPIDERS ARANEAE; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; TAXONOMY	This paper provides formal descriptions of some of the unnamed taxa that were included in the most recent molecular phylogeny of pholcid spiders (Eberle et al. 2018, BMC Evolutionary Biology, 18, 141). The focus is on new genera and on species that belong to recently revised genera. Eight new genera and 25 new species are formally described. In Arteminae, three new species are described in Artema Walckenaer, 1837: A. bahla sp. n., A. ghubrat sp. n., and A. dhofar sp. n. (all from Oman); five new species in Arnapa gen. n. (eastern Indonesia and New Guinea): A. arfak sp. n., A. tinoor sp. n., A. manokwari sp. n., A. meja sp. n., A. tolire sp. n.; and one new species in Chisosa Huber, 2000: C. caquetio sp. n. (Netherlands Antilles). In Ninetinae, three new monotypic genera are described: Pemona gen. n., with the type species P sapo sp. n. (Venezuela); Pinocchio gen. n., with the type species P. barauna sp. n. (Brazil); and Magana gen. n., with the type species M. velox sp. n. (Oman). In Modisiminae, three new species are described in Chibchea Huber, 2000 (all from Brazil): C. amapa sp. n., C. santosi sp. n., and C. hamadae sp. n.; one new species in Psilochorus Simon, 1893: P bromelicolus sp. n. (Brazil); and three new monotypic genera, all from Brazil: Arenita gen. n., with the type species A. fazendinha sp. n.; Kairona gen. n., with the type species K. selva sp. n.; and Saciperere gen. n., with the type species S. catuaba sp. n. In Pholcinae, a new monotypic genus is described: Giloloa gen. n., with the type species G sofifi sp. n. (Indonesia); three new species in the genus Aetana Huber, 2005 (all from Indonesia): A. ternate sp. n.; A. mokwam sp. n.; A. ondawamei sp. n.; and two new species in the genus Panjange Deeleman-Reinhold & Deeleman, 1983 (both from Indonesia): P thomi sp. n., and P. togutil sp. n. Artema ghubrat is a cave-dwelling species and the only (slightly) troglomorphic representative of Arteminae; A. dhofar is presumably the closest known relative of the pantropical and synanthropic A. atlanta. The new genus Arnapa is probably species rich in eastern Indonesia and New Guinea but poorly collected; its morphological delimitation from other Australasian Arteminae (Wugigarra Huber, 2001; Holocneminus Berland, 1942; Trichocyclus Simon, 1908) needs further study. Arnapa nigromaculatus (Kulczyliski, 1911) comb. n. is newly transferred from Psilochorus. Pemona sapo is the first representative of Ninetinae from Venezuela. The genus Chibchea, previously known from the Andes only, is for the first time recorded from Brazil/lowland Amazonia. Arenita fazendinha is among the few species in Pholcidae with extremely reduced procursus and barely modified male chelicerae. Kairona selva is unique among Pholcidae for its brush of strong hairs on a median horn anteriorly on the ocular area. Saciperere catuaba is one of only four pholcid species currently known to occur both in the Amazon and in the Atlantic Forest; however, variation indicates that more than one species might be included. It is among the few spiders known to have asymmetric genitalia (antisymmetric female internal genitalia). The Brazilian Psilochorus bromelicolus is the first South American Psilochorus of which both sexes are adequately described; however, the assignment to Psilochorus is tentative. Aetana ternate has extremely elongated procursi and accordingly elongated female internal genitalia. Aetana ondawamei and A. mokwam have almost identical male pedipalps and chelicerae (except for size) but differ clearly in the female genitalia.

Macrobiotus dulciporus sp. nov. belongs to the hufelandi group and is most similar to Macrobiotus maculatus Iharos, 1973. It differs from M maculatus mainly based on the presence of an oral cavity armature of the patagonicus type, smooth egg chorion surface, lower number of processes on the egg circumference and some morphometric characters of the egg processes. Echiniscus hannae sp. nov. belongs to the bigranulatus group, but differs from all species in this group due to the presence of large, smooth areas on its dorsal plate.

A splendid new leaf-tailed gecko (Uroplatus) species from Marojejy National Park in north-eastern Madagascar	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Squamata; Gekkonidae; Uroplatus ebenaui group; Uroplatus finaritra sp. nov.; Marojejy; Madagascar	FIMBRIATUS; PATTERNS; TAXONOMY; MASSIF	The Marojejy Massif in northern Madagascar is a constant source of herpetological surprises. Herein we describe a new species of leaf-mimicking leaf-tailed gecko, Uroplatus finaritra sp. nov., based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic evidence. This new species inhabits the rainforests of Marojejy National Park at low elevations and is morphologically similar to Uroplatus phantasticus, but differs by having a larger body size, relatively shorter tail, and dark-red pigmentation of the oral mucosa. Molecular data reveals a distance of 14.0-14.7% in the 16S rRNA gene to U. phantasticus, and haplotype sharing in the c-mos nuclear gene only with species of much shorter tails (i.e., with U. kelirambo and two undescribed candidate species). Similar to other members of the leaf-mimicking Uroplatus species in northern Madagascar, Uroplatus finaritra sp. nov. likely has a small geographic distribution, and is currently known only from the lowland rainforests of Marojejy. We discuss the value of the buccal mucosa colouration and tail dimensions of Uroplatus as taxonomic characters, and the potential drivers of their evolution. In order to reduce the risk of international trade under incorrect species names we suggest that exported CITES species should be obligatorily accompanied by information about their precide geographic origin within Madagascar.

A revision of Lachnodius Maskell (Hemiptera, Coccomorpha, Eriococcidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Australian endemics; gall-inducer; taxonomy	FELT SCALES; GENUS; COCCOIDEA	Lachnodius Maskell is a genus of three named species that are part of an Australian radiation of felt scale insects that induce galls on Eucalyptus and Cotymbia (Myrtaceae). A female's gall usually consists of an open-top pit in swollen plant tissue. Depending on the species, galls can occur on a host's leaves, buds, stems, or trunk. Here, we redescribe the named species: L. eucalypti (Maskell), L. hirsutus (Froggatt) and L. lectularius (Maskell), and describe seven new species: L. brimblecombei Beardsley, Gullan & Hardy, sp. n., L. froggatti Beardsley, Gullan & Hardy, sp. n., L. maculosus Beardsley, Gullan & Hardy, sp. n., L. melliodorae Beardsley, Gullan & Hardy, sp. n., L. newi Beardsley, Gullan & Hardy, sp. n., L. parathrix Beardsley, Gullan & Hardy, sp. n., L. sealakeensis Gullan & Hardy, sp. n. Descriptions are based primarily on adult females, but for some species short diagnoses of nymphal stages also are provided. The taxonomic history of Lachnodius is reviewed, with notes on their biology and ecology. A key to species based on the morphology of adult females is provided, and lectotypes are designated for Dactylopius eucalypti Maskell and Lachnodius lectularius Maskell.

Description of a new species of the genus Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 (Reptilia: Squamata: Gekkonidae) from the Nilgala Savannah forest, Uva Province of Sri Lanka	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Autecology; Conservation; Microendemic; Reproduction; Systematics; Threats	SAURIA GEKKONIDAE; WESTERN-GHATS; DAY-GECKO; ROCK GECKO; SP NOV.; PHYLOGENY; CONSERVATION; DISCOVERY; SUMATRA	A new species of Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 is described from Nilgala Savannah Forest in Sri Lanka. The new species is diagnosed from all other congeners by the following suite of characters: small body size (SVL< 33 mm), dorsal scales on trunk homogeneous, one pair of post mentals separated by a single small chin scale, ventral scales on trunk smooth, subimbricate, 17-19 scales across the belly. Subdigitals scansors smooth, entire, unnotched; lamellae under digit IV of pes 17 -18. Males with femoral pores on each thigh but lacking precloacal pores. Median row of subcaudals smooth, subimbricate, enlarged and in an irregular series of subhexagonal scales. This new species had been previously confused with Cnemaspis alwisi Wickramasinghe & Munidradasa, 2007. The new species differs from Cnemaspis alwisi by having 122129 ventral scales (versus 146-152), 7-8 supralabials (versus 8-10), and relatively shorter SVL ranging between 31.532.9 mm (versus 37.8-39.9 mm). Further, the new species is genetically divergent from Cnemaspis alwisi, the species that it closely resembles by 13.5% and 7.8% from its sister species in the ND2 gene. The present discovery highlights the need for dedicated herpetofaunal explorations in Sri Lanka, especially the intermediate bioclimatic zone and associated cave systems and rock outcrops.

The new species was collected in a previous study that compared the vertebrate and invertebrate symbiont communities living in the tubes of two syntopic species of the polychaete genus Chaetopterus. Polyonyx socialis sp. n. inhabits the tubes of the smaller polychaete species as a heterosexual pair, and frequently shares the cavity of the host's tube with a larger porcellanid, P. heok, also present as a male-female pair, and with a species of trinchesiid nudibranch. Less frequently, the new species shares its host with a heterosexual pair of a larger species of pinnotherid crab. Polyonyx socialis sp. n. belongs to the P. sinensis group, a world-wide distributed morphological line within the heterogeneous genus Polyonyx. Most species in this group are obligate commensals of chaetopterid polychaetes. The crabs have a transversally cylindrical habitus, which enables them to move laterally along the worm tubes with ease. Polyonyx socialis sp. n. is a relatively small species that lives attached to the inner walls of the polychaete tube. The small size and flattened chelipeds and walking legs of the new species confers it an advantage to cohabiting the same worm tube with larger decapod species occupying most of the tube's cavity.

In the Nearctic region, the new species is morphologically similar to G. curriei Krombein, 1962, but it is distinguished by the dull and granulated metapostonotum; in G. curriei the metapostnotum is shiny and unsculptured. The new species belongs to Gonatopus group 7. The keys to the females of the Nearctic and Neotropical species of this group are modified to include the new taxon.

Since 1961, Pyura vittata (Stimpson, 1852) has been reported to the Southwest Atlantic but new collections and a revision of the morphological characters of samples deposited in scientific collections revealed that samples had been confused with two other species: Pyura gangelion (Savigny, 1816) and Pyura beta sp. nov. present in the Caribbean sea and Brazil. In Brazil, P. vittata is not present south to Bahia, P beta was found from Espirito Santo to Sao Paulo, while P. gangelion was only found in Espirito Santo, and we suggest that populations of both P beta and P. gangelion are non-native in Brazil.

Glon et al. (2018) investigated this claim and found that L. diogenes sensu lato was actually a species complex. The authors redescribed L. diogenes and restricted its range to the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Piedmont ecoregions of eastern North America. In doing so, they also revealed the existence of several probable undescribed species of Lacunicambarus that were previously considered to be L. diogenes. Here, we use morphological and molecular techniques to distinguish and describe one of these species: Lacunicambarus chimera sp. nov., a large primary burrowing crayfish found in parts of the Lower Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and Upper Mississippi River Basins. Lacunicambarus chimera is morphologically similar to L. diogenes, from which it can be distinguished by the greater number of spines on the ventrolateral margin of its merus, its wider antennal scale terminating in a short spine, and the presence of a single longitudinal stripe on the dorsal side of its abdomen. We also provide an updated key to Lacunicambarus.

In total 34 species are treated, nine of which are described as new. A new genus and new species are as follows: Bellavalentis gen. n., (type species Dolichoctis kuzugamii Shibata, 1967); Amphimenes absensacidus sp. n.; Amphimenes beichatiensis sp. n.; Amphimenes carinacaulis sp. n.; Catascopus (s. str.) asaharti sp. n.; Catascopus (s. str.) viridiorchis sp. n.; Coptodera (Coptoderina) occulta sp. n.; Dolichoctis badiadorsis sp. n.; Dolichoctis dilatata sp. n.; Moctherus obscurabasis sp. n. After close examination of the type material of several species, we were able to determine that Coptoderina chaudoiri anguilipennis (Nakane and Okhura) is a junior synonym of Coptodera (Coptoderina) chaudoiri Andrewes, syn. n. and Coptodera nobilis Jedlicka is also a junior synonym of C. chaudoiri, syn. n. Dolichoctis striatus formosanus Habu is a junior synonym of Dolichoctis rotundata (Schmidt-Goebel), syn. n. Dolichoctis (Mochtherus) uenoi Habu is a junior synonym of Mochtherus luctuosus Putzeys, syn. n. Pericalus formosanus Dupuis was recently ranked as a subspecies of Pericalus ornatus formosanus Dupuis. After consideration of the several consistent taxonomic characteristics and also considering its allopatric distribution with all other species of Pericalus, we believe Pericalus formosanus Dupuis to be a valid species, stat. resurr. The monobasic genus Pseudomenarus (type species Pseudomenarus flavomaculatus Shibata, 1964) is established as conspecific with members of the genus Formosiella Jedlicka, 1951, comb. n. Species previously recorded from Taiwan that are not present here include: Amphimenes piceolus Bates; Catascopus aequatus Dejean; Catascopus facialis (Wiedemann) Coptodera interrupta Schmidt-Goebel Coptodera flexuosa Schmidt-Goebel and Peripristus ater (Laporte). The pericaline taxa of Taiwan are arranged in 14 genera, five subgenera, and 34 currently known species. Notes on collecting circumstances, habits, and habitat are included when known.

Cyrtodactylus taybacensis sp. nov. is distinguished from the remaining Indochinese bent-toed geckos by a combination of the following characters: medium size (SVL up to 97.5 mm); dorsal tubercles in 13-16 irregular rows; ventral scale rows 30-38; ventrolateral folds present without interspersed tubercles; each thigh with 11-13 enlarged femoral scales; femoral pores absent in males and females; precloacal pores 11-13 in males, five or 15 pitted scales in females, in a continuous row; postcloacal tubercles two or three; lamellae under toe IV 16-20; subcaudal scales transversely enlarged; dorsal head with dark brown marking, oval, triangle and arched shape; five brown dorsal bands between limb insertions. In phylogenetic analyses, the new species is recovered as a member of the Cyrtodactylus wayakonei species group, and strongly supported as the sister taxon of C. cf bichnganae from Son La City in all analyses.

In our sampling in the northern Western Ghats, we encountered a new lineage sister to the phylogenetic cluster which comprises the 'Rufescens complex'. This new lineage is described here as new species Fejervarya marathi sp. nov. based on distinctness in a combination of morphological characters, genetic distance and geography. The problems in morphological groupings for the Fejervarya frogs of the Western Ghats in the recent studies are discussed with the sub-clade composition based on geography in the phylogenetic tree.

SP.	Podonomus is one of the richest genera of Podonominae, with 44 species described. With wide distribution in South America, Podonomus species are an important component of aquatic ecosystems such as streams and madicolous habitats. However, its larval stages have been historically overlooked, with only six species described. After visiting Brundin's collection, we were able to recover information on larvae of three species mentioned in his monograph. Here we describe the larvae of P. apolobambae and P. setosus, provide a broad description of the P. albinervis larva and present an identification key to the known larvae of the genus, including the other five species whose larvae are described, P. amarali, P. fastigians, P. pepinellii, P. quito and P. tehuelche.

There are the first members of the genus found outside Yunnan Province of China. The taxonomic position of the new species within the genus is discussed based on the relevant character states in external and genital morphology. Both newly described species are closely related to each other and seem to form a distinct species-group within extremely diverse genus Uenoites. Externally, the newly described species are much more similar to very large members of the genus Queinnectrechus Deuve, 1992, than to most Uenoites but differs in an increased number of elytral setiferous pores in stria 3 and in the presence of the preapical pore.

Cirolanides wassenichae sp. nov., a freshwater, subterranean Cirolanidae (Isopoda, Cymothoida) with additional records of other species from Texas, United States	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Edwards Aquifer; Stygobiont; Aquifer Biodiversity; Cirolanides texensis; Speocirolana hardeni; cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1); large ribosomal subunit 28S	CRUSTACEA OSTRACODA; EDWARDS AQUIFER; CANDONIDAE; GENUS; DIVERSITY	Cirolanides wassenichae sp. nov., is described from the phreatic zone of the Edwards Aquifer, Texas, USA where it is sympatric with Cirolanides texensis Benedict, 1896. Its status as a new species is based on both morphological and molecular data. Number of antennula articles (3-5 vs 9-15), size (mean sizes of 9.5 and 8.8 mm vs 11.1 and 10.4 mm for males and females, respectively), morphology of pereopods 1-3 (haptorial to semi-haptorial in 1-3 vs only 1 haptorial), and shape of pleotelson (squared, slightly indented vs rounded) are key morphological characteristics that distinguish C. wassenichae sp. nov. from C. texensis. Phylogenies based on cytochrome oxidase 1 and large ribosomal subunit 28S show that divergent morphologies correspond to reciprocally monophyletic groups for both nuclear and mitochondrial datasets. The genus Cirolanides is in need of revision, as our description of C. wassenichae sp. nov. renders C. texensis paraphyletic.

The new species resembles M. butleri morphologically, but differs from all congeners by a combination of the following morphological attributes: (1) medium-sized adult snout-vent length 25.2-27.0 mm in 15 males and 30.5 mm in a single female; (2) body habitus moderately stocky; (3) head flat, snout rounded, slightly prominent in ventral profile; (4) dorsum and flanks slightly shagreened with evenly scattered tiny tubercles, ventral skin smooth; (5) first finger well developed, more than one-half the length of the second finger; (6) tips of three outer fingers slightly enlarged, forming weak disks and tips of all toes distinctly dilated into wide disks with narrow peripheral grooves; (7) finger and toe disks with dorsal median longitudinal grooves; (8) three palmar tubercles and two metatarsal tubercles; (9) tibiotarsal articulation of adpressed limb reaching slightly beyond the orbit; (10) webbing formula: I 13/4-2 II 11/2-23/4 III 2-31/3 IV 31/4-11/2 V; (11) in life, chin and throat yellowish to bright-orange with tiny dark brown speckling laterally; and (12) a call consisting of 15-26 pulses with a dominant frequency of 1.8-2.2 kHz (recorded at 18.5 degrees C). We also provide a preliminary genealogy of Microhyla based on analysis of a 2644 bp fragment of 12S-16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA. Based on the examed data, the new species and M. butleri are sister-species (genetic p-distance: 9.0%) and it can be distinguished from M. butleri by its morphology (size, webbing on toes, color) and advertisement call. Interspecific genetic p-distances between the new species and its congeners vary from 9.0% to 14.8%. Microhyla aurantiventris sp. nov. occurs in evergreen montane tropical forests at elevations around 1200 m a.s.l. and is known only from the type locality. The new species appears to be threatened due to intensive logging and agriculture plantation.

This paper describes a new species, Caromiobenella ohtsukai sp. n., based on the display of reduced, knob-like fifth legs on the ventral side of the first urosomal somite. A unique combination of male genitalia features and number of caudal setae further confirms its specificity. Molecular analysis based on two partial gene sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) and 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA) also supports the designation of this species by showing a relevant divergence from known congeners. Caromiobenella ohtsukai sp. n. is the ninth member of this genus and also the ninth monstrilloid reported from Korea.

The organism was retrieved using the human-occupied vehicle Shinkai 6500 during the QUEUE 2013 expedition. This is the 26th species of the genus and the first discovery from the South Atlantic Ocean, representing the deepest record of Osedax worldwide to date. This species morphologically resembles Osedax frankpressi but is distinguished by the presence of a yellow bump or patch behind the prostomium and its trunk length. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using three genetic markers (COI, 16S, and 18S) showed that O. braziliensis sp. n. is distinct from all other Osedax worms reported and is a sister species of O. frankpressi.

The female of the new species differs from other species of the A. (O.) erythraea Giesbrecht, 1889 species group in the absence of a pair of sharp spines on the posterior border of the genital double-somite and absence of setules on the lateral margins of urosomites 1-3. Unlike other congeners of the species group, males of the new species lack fine setules along the posterior margin of the prosome. Comparison of the new species with A. (O.) pacifica by pairwise distance data for the 16S (282 bp) gene indicates that these species differ by 20-21%, while the COI gene (636 bp) indicates a difference of 16-17%. The new species seems to be a coastal, occurring in warm waters having a salinity of 33.5.

Examination of primary type specimens and newer material confirm one new species Etheophanus kuscheli sp. n. and two synonomies (Etheophanus nitidellus Broun, 1923 [-Etheophanus obscurus Broun, 1923] and Etheophanus striatus Broun, 1910 [-Etheophanus punctiventris Broun, 1914]). Generic and species diagnoses, a key to the species, and lectotype designations for three species are included. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on a combined analysis of the nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I genes confirmed the status of E. kuscheli and a species complex, the E. nitidellus/E. optandus clade distributed in the southern portion of the South Island. The relationship E. pinguis [northern North Island] (E. striatus [southern North Island, northern South Island] (E. kuscheli [northwestern South Island] (E. nitidellus, E. optandus [southwestern North Island]) corresponds to geographic patterns found in other beetle lineages. Etheophanus striatus is composed of three lineages, one widespread in the north and south islands and two allopatric populations in the northwest South Island.

The first stygobiont species of Coleoptera from Portugal, with a molecular phylogeny of the Siettitia group of genera (Dytiscidae, Hydroporinae, Hydroporini, Siettitiina)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Diving beetles; groundwater; new species; stygofauna; troglomorphy	SUBTERRANEAN FAUNA; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; WATER BEETLE; GENUS; RHITHRODYTES; PLACEMENT	Iberoporus pluto sp. n., the first stygobiont beetle from Portugal (Dytiscidae, Hydroporinae), is described from a single female from the cave Soprador do Carvalho (Coimbra). The species is highly troglomorphic, depigmented, blind, and with elongated appendages not adapted for swimming. A molecular phylogeny based on a combination of three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes showed the new species to be sister to I. cermenius Castro & Delgado, 2001 from Cordoba (south of Spain), within the subtribe Siettitiina of the tribe Hydroporini. Both species are included in a Glade with Siettitia avenionensis Guignot, 1925 (south of France) and Rhitbrodytes agnus Foster, 1992 and R. aragaensis Fery & Baton, 1996 (north of Portugal), in turn sister to the rest of species of genus Rhithrodytes Bameul, 1989, in what is here considered the Siettitia group of genera. We resolve the paraphyly of Rhitbrodytes by transferring the two Portuguese species to lberoporus Castro & Delgado, 2001, I. again (Foster, 1992), comb. n. and I. argaensis (Fery & Bilton, 1996), comb. n.

Two new species are described from Morocco, S. brusteli sp. n. from the Rif and S. comasi sp. n. from the High Atlas, the first in the S. vandalitiae-group of species and the second with an isolated position within the genus. Two species are also resurrected from synonymy, S. pulchellus (Reitter, 1885) stat. rest. (former synonym of S. orchesioides (Fairmaire, 1879)) and S. gracilis (Kraatz, 1870) stat. rest. (former synonym of S. vandalitiae (Heyden, 1870)), raising the total number of species of the genus to 16. Lectotypes are designated for Anemadus pulchellus Reitter, 1885, and Anemadus tenuipes Peyerimhoff, 1917. A molecular phylogeny of the genus Speonemadus is presented, based on a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear genes and including seven of the currently recognised species, one of the newly described (S. brusteli sp. n.) and the two reinstated taxa. The genus is estimated to have diversified from the late Miocene (Tortonian), with successive cladogenetic events related to the isolation of landmasses between Iberia and North Africa, including the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar at the end of the Messinian. The distribution of some of the species of Speonemadus remains still uncertain, due to their frequent misidentification and the problems with their taxonomic status.

We also provide a definition of the new subfamily Chaetosciarinae and describe common morphological key characters. Three Korean Chaetosciarinae species in three genera are reported, all of which are new to Korea and one (Scythropochroa pseudoquercicola sp. nov.) of which is new to science. A previous molecular phylogenetic study designated Scy. pseudoquercicola as an unidentified species.

J	Galassi, DMP; Fiers, F; Dole-Olivier, MJ; Fiasca, B				Galassi, Diana M. P.; Fiers, Frank; Dole-Olivier, Marie-Jose; Fiasca, Barbara			Discovery of a new species of the genus Stygepactophanes from a groundwater-fed spring in southern France (Crustacea, Copepoda, Harpacticoida, Canthocamptidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Groundwater; stygobite; systematics; taxonomy; Var catchment	TAXA BIODIVERSITY INVENTORY; N. SP.; REDESCRIPTION; ECOLOGY; WATERS; CAVES; ATBI	A new species of the genus Stygepaetophanes Moeschler & Rouch, 1984 (Copepoda, Harpacticoida, Canthocamptidae) is established to accommodate a small canthocamptid population collected from a spring system in the "Parc du Mercantour", Var catchment, southern France. The population analysed in the present study is defined by a set of morphological characters of the female, namely a very large maxilliped, a rudimentary mandibular palp, P1 with 3-segmented exopod and 2-segmented endopod, a falcate terminal claw of the P1 endopod, dorsal seta of caudal rami inserted on the inner margin, and anal operculum not overreaching the insertion of the caudal rami, thus supporting its assignment into the genus Stygepactophanes. The new species Stygepactophanes oceitanus shows marked differences with the nominotypical species of the genus that was originally described by monotypy with the species Stygepactophanes jurassicus Moeschler & Rouch, 1984. The main diagnostic traits of S. jurassicus are the absence of the P5 and a falcate outer terminal claw of P1 endopod. Stygepactophanes jumssicus also shows a reduced armature of the antennal exopod, bearing one seta, 1-segmented P2-P4 endopods, a reduced armature of P2-P4 exopodal segments 3 (3,4,4 armature elements, respectively), P6 bearing only one long seta, a rounded short and smooth anal operculum. Conversely the female of S. occitanus Galassi & Fiers, sp. n. has a well-developed P5, with rudimentary intercoxal sclerite, together with a falcate outer terminal claw of P1 endopod, antennal exopod bearing two elements, P4 endopod 1-segmented versus 2-segmented in P2-P3, P2-P4 exopodal segment 3 with five armature elements, P6 with three setae of different lengths, rounded anal operculum, bearing 3-4 strong spinules. According to our present knowledge, S. occitanus Galassi & Fiers, sp. n. is assigned to the genus Stygepactophanes as the most conservative solution, waiting for the male to be discovered. The genus Stygepactophanes represents a distinct lineage within the harpacticoid family Canthocamptidae that colonised southern European groundwater, the genus being known only from the saturated karst in Switzerland and a fissured saturated aquifer in southern France. Both species of the genus are stygobites and narrow endemics, the nominotypical specks being known from the type locality Source de la Doux in Dlemont (Switzerland), and S. occitanus Galassi & Fiers, sp. n. described herein from a spring system of the Var catchment (France).

In total, 62 carabid species and subspecies representing 39 genera, 17 tribes, and 10 subfamilies were identified, including one new species, Paussus minutulus Nagel & Rasool, sp. n, four new country records, and 24 species that are new provincial records for Baha. The carabid fauna was dominated by the Lebiini with 19 species. A high number of species were rarely collected (34 species) in comparison to the more abundant and common species (9 species). The highest number of species (52 species) was collected during autumn. The carabids of SANR are represented by a large component of Afrotropical faunal elements (28.1%) and smaller numbers of Oriental species (3.5%) and endemic taxa (5.3%). In comparison to Garf Raydah Nature Reserve in Asir Province, also in southwestern Saudi Arabia, SANR had an equal number of carabids sharing 64.5% of the species but with lower number of endemic elements. Our study can serve as a component for implementing a conservation plan for SANR using carabid beetles as sentinel taxa. These research results may support future ecological studies on SNAR carabids.

Amolops sinensis sp. n. from central Guangdong, north-eastern Guangxi and southwestern Hunan can be distinguished by the longitudinal glandular folds on the skin of the shoulders and other character combinations. Amolops yatseni sp. n. from the coastal hills of west Guangdong can be distinguished by the dense tiny round translucent, or white, spines on the dorsal skin of the body, dorsal and dorsolateral skin of the limbs, and other character combinations. The phylogenetic interrelationships of the A. ricketti group have been inferred as (A. wuyiensis + A. ricketti) + (A. yunkaiensis + (A. albispinus + (A. sinensis sp. n. + A. yatseni sp. n.))). This work indicates that the current records of A. ricketti might be a species complex composed of multiple species, and further work is needed to figure out this puzzle.

To clarify the relationships among different populations, the type locality of the species (Clare Island, Ireland) and several Italian localities were sampled. Populations were investigated with an integrated approach, using morphological (LM, CLSM, SEM), morphometric, karyological, and molecular (18S rRNA, cox1 genes) data. Paramacrobiotus richtersi was redescribed and a neotype designed from the Irish bisexual population. Animals of all populations had very similar qualitative and quantitative characters, apart from the absence of males and the presence of triploidy in some of them, whereas some differences were recorded in the egg shell. All populations examined had the same 18S haplotype, while 21 haplotypes were found in the cox1 gene. In four cases, those qualitative characters were correlated with clear molecular (cox1) differences (genetic distance 14.6-21.8%). The integrative approach, which considered the morphological differences in the eggs, the reproductive biology and the wide genetic distances among putative species, led to the description of four new species (Paramacrobiotus arduus sp. n., Paramacrobiotus celsus sp. n., Paramacrobiotus depressus sp. n., Paramacrobiotus spatialis sp. n.) and two Unconfirmed Candidate Species (UCS) within the P. richtersi complex. Paramacrobiotus fairbanksi, the only ascertained parthenogenetic, triploid species, was redescribed and showed a wide distribution (Italy, Spain, Poland, Alaska), while the amphimictic species showed limited distributions. The difference in distribution between apomictic and amphimictic populations can be explained by the difference in the dispersal potentials associated with these two types of reproduction.

J	Goncalves, RB				Goncalves, Rodrigo Barbosa			New species of Neocorynura Schrottky from Brazil (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						bees; Halictidae; Neotropical; systematics; taxonomy	AUGOCHLORINI HYMENOPTERA; HALICTIDAE; PHYLOGENY; SENSILLA; KEY	Neocorynura Schrottky is one of the most speciose genera in the Augochlorini with about 80 species. Neocorynura is primarily distributed in the Neotropical region, from Argentina to Mexico. New species have been described recently, but the Brazilian fauna has not been studied at the same rate. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide a revision of Neocorynura species from Brazil. More than 2,500 specimens were studied along with the examination of primary type specimens and/or high resolution photographs of type material. A total of 44 species were recognized, 24 new species are added to the fauna and figured as N acuta sp. nov., N. aethra sp. nov., N. amabilis sp. nov., N arethusa sp. nov., N. aurantia sp. nov., N carmenta sp. nov., N. dictyata sp. nov., N eliasi sp. nov., N hebe sp. nov., N. hyalina sp. nov., N. insolita sp. nov., N. laevistriata sp. nov., N. lamellata sp. nov., N. meloi sp. nov., N. nambikwar a sp. nov., N nicolle sp. nov., N. olivacea sp. nov., N perfida sp. nov., N. pilosifacies sp. nov., N. proserpina sp. nov., N. rubicunda sp. nov., N. surrufa sp. nov., N truncata sp. nov., and N. veneta sp. nov. I designate the lectotype for Corynura oiospermi Schrottky and consider this name as a junior synonym of Halictus codion Vachal. Augochloropsis celaeno Schrottky is considered a junior synonym of Corynura pseudobaccha Cockerell. Casosoma semimarginata Cockerell is resurrected from synonymy with Cacosoma aenigma Gribodo. Neocorynura aenigma (Gribodo) and Neocorynura caligans (Vachal) are removed from the faunal list for Brazil. Half of species recognized here are known only for the female. The males of N atromarginata (Cockerell), N. cuprifrons (Smith), N. dilutipes (Vachal) N. erinnys (Schrottky), N. melamptera (Moure), N. roxane (Schrottky) and N semimarginata (Cockerell) and females of N. iopodion (Vachal) and N. jucunda (Smith) are described for the first time. Identification keys to females and males are presented.

The hypogean invertebrate fauna of Georgia (Caucasus)	ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST			English	Article						Cave invertebrates; distribution; endemism; diversity; Georgia	WESTERN GEORGIA; SP NOV.; CAVE; DIPLOPODA; TROGLOCARIS; AMPHIPODS; GENUS	Information about the cave invertebrates of Georgia, Caucasus, is summarised, resulting in 43 troglo- and 43 stygobiont taxa reported from 64 caves. Species distribution analyses were conducted for 61 caves harbouring 58 invertebrate taxa, with the majority of caves (39) located in Apkhazeti (north-western Georgia). In 22 caves from central-west Georgia (Samegrelo, Imereti and Racha-Lechkhumi regions of west Georgia) 31 taxa are reported. Composition of cave fauna differed strongly between the caves in Apkhazeti and the central-west of Georgia. Only two taxa of the total 86 were shared, resulting in negligible similarity (Sorensen-Dice coefficient S-s=4.8%). Rarefaction indicated an increase in number of species with additional sampling could increase species richness from 58 to 76 for caves in Apkhazeti and from 31 to 69 for caves in central-west Georgia. These findings suggest that the low invertebrate species richness observed in caves of western Georgia is the result of insufficient sampling. A pairwise approach to analysing species co-occurrence showed ten positive spatial associations in 7 out of 86 cave species, all from Kveda Shakurani and Tsebelda caves. The species co-occurring in the same microhabitat require further study to understand their relationships.

Damages caused to the hosts include mechanical (tissue injury), biochemical (malfunction of digestive enzymes), and molecular (affects cellular immune response) effects. However, coccidiosis is not a fatal disease to the cephalopod host; it severely weakens its innate immunity making it vulnerable to secondary infections. Therefore, coccidia of the genus Aggregata are considered the most dangerous parasite for cephalopods affecting wild species of notable economic importance for fishery and aquaculture activity. The pathology caused by coccidiosis to the most important European cephalopod species is the subject of the present chapter.

A new species of dwarf day gecko (Reptilia: Gekkonidae: Cnemaspis) from lower-elevations of Samanala Nature Reserve in Central massif, Sri Lanka	AMPHIBIAN & REPTILE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Arboreal; conservation; ecology; rainforest; redlist; taxonomy; Sripadha; threats	SQUAMATA GEKKONIDAE; SP NOV.; STRAUCH; RANGE; FOREST	A new day gecko species of genus Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 is described from a midland forested area of Udamaliboda (north-western foothills of Samanala Nature Reserve) in Sri Lanka. This species is medium in size (30-35 mm SVL) and can be differentiated from all other Sri Lankan congeners by a suite of distinct morphometric, meristic, and color characters (dorsum with smooth and homogeneous granular scales; chin, gular, pectoral, and abdominal scales smooth; precloacal pores absent in males, 14-15 femoral pores separated by 9-11 unpored interfemoral scales in males; subcaudals smooth, subhexagonal, enlarged, subequal, forming a regular median row). It was recorded from tall trees with smooth bark in home gardens, and also on clay walls in very old tall houses in wet, cool, and shady forests, distributed across mid elevations (similar to 450-650 m) with limited anthropogenic disturbance. They can climb to heights of 7 m on vertical surfaces of trees. The most noteworthy behavior of this species is that when "scared," it runs only upward to the canopy of the tree or along the wall to hide within crevices. The major threats for this species in Udamaliboda and other locations in lower Samanala Nature Reserve are habitat loss due to expansion of commercial-scale agriculture and monoculture plantations, and illicit forest encroachments. Therefore, these foothill forests warrant special conservation, habitat protection, further in-depth research, and specific hands-on management practices.

The new species, Hyalinobatrachium adespinosai sp. nov., can be differentiated from all other centrolenids by the combination of its coloration (transparent peritoneum and pericardium) and vocalization (call duration = 0.38-0.44 s, with 9-13 pulses per call; dominant frequency = 4,645-5,001 Hz). However, H. adespinosai sp. nov. is morphologically cryptic with H. anachoretus, H. esmeralda, and H. pellucidum, from which it differs by call traits (in H. anachoretus: call duration = 0.32-0.37 s, with 5 or 6 pulses per call, dominant frequency = 4,670-4,800 Hz; in H. esmeralda: call duration = 0.218-0.257 s, tonal call, dominant frequency = 4,739-5,580 Hz; in H. pellucidum: call duration = 0.112-0.140 s, tonal, dominant frequency = 5,000-5,710 Hz). Biogeographically, the new species is separated from H. anachoretus by a considerable distance and, also, the Maranon valley. Finally, following IUCN conservation criteria, the status of the new species is considered as Data Deficient.

The three new species can be differentiated from all other Hemidactylus inhabitants of Iran and adjacent area congeners by distinct morphometric, meristic, and color characters. Comparisons with other species of Hemidactylus are presented and a key to the genus is provided. Some information about the ecology, biology, and conservation of the three new species is provided. Existing data suggest these geckos are point endemics. Some additional historical information about the Hemidactylus inhabitants of Iran is discussed, particularly H. parkeri.

Three new species of day geckos (Reptilia: Gekkonidae: Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887) from isolated granite cave habitats in Sri Lanka	AMPHIBIAN & REPTILE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Climate condition; endangered species; habitat specialist; isolated forest; point endemic; range restriction; systematics; taxonomy	SQUAMATA GEKKONIDAE; SAURIA GEKKONIDAE; SP NOV.; GENUS; PHYLOGENY; RICHNESS; MENTAWAI; SUMATRA; REVEALS; FOREST	Three new day gecko species of the genus Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 are described from three isolated granite cave habitats with rock walls in Bambaragala (Ratnapura District), Dimbulagala (Polonnaruwa District), and Mandaramnuwara (Nuwara-Eliya District) in Sri Lanka based on morphometric and meristic characters. All of these new species are assigned to the kandiana clade based on morphology. These species are small (28-35 mm SVL) in size and may be differentiated from all other Sri Lankan congeners by a suite of distinct morphometric and meristic characters. Each of these species described herein are categorized as Critically Endangered (CR) under IUCN Red List criteria. At the microhabitat scale, they are restricted to wet, cool, and shady granite caves and rock outcrops in isolated forested areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. Further, these habitats are located in all three main bioclimatic zones (wet, intermediate, dry) and all three geographic peneplains (first, second, third) of Sri Lanka. Due to their restricted distributions (as point endemics), the habitats of these specialist species are vulnerable to fragmentation, edge effects, and anthropogenic activities. Therefore, these isolated forest patches in Sri Lanka are in need of special conservation attention and management.

We describe one new species, Xestoleberis hujeongensis n. sp., and report three other cytheroid ostracods: X. setouchiensis Okubo, 1979; X. sagamiensis Okubo, 1976; and Hemicytherura kajiyarnai Hanai, 1957 from the east coast of Korea. The new species is most closely related to Xestoleberis hanaii Ishizaki, 1968, a widely distributed and ecologically versatile species. The two species have a very similar carapace shape and soft body parts morphology. Nevertheless, the new species has a distinctively different carapace ornament (presence of wart-like structures on the male carapace), as well as hemipenis morphology. The other three species were known so far only from Japan, and the South Korean populations differ from the Japanese ones only by carapace size, while the carapace shape and all soft body parts are very similar to their original descriptions. This is also the first record of a living representative of the genus Hemicytherura Elofson, 1941 from Korea.

One species is newly recorded in the equatorial Pacific, and the other two species are new to science. Triconia komo n. sp. is closely related to T. hawii (Bottger-Schnack & Boxshall, 1990), but differs distinctly in the relative length of the outer basal seta on P5 in the female as well as slightly in the relative length of the seta VI on caudal ramus in both sexes. Triconia onnuri n. sp. closely resembles T. similis (Sars, 1918), but females can be distinguished by the relative length of the outer exopodal seta and the outer basal seta on P5. Both sexes differ from T. similis in the relative lengths of endopodal spines on swimming legs 3 and 4 as well as in the form of caudal seta VI. The female of Triconia denticula Wi, Shin & Soh, 2011, which is newly recorded in the equatorial Pacific, is redescribed including morphological details and differences compared to the original description from Korean waters. The type material of T. denticula deposited in the National Institute of Biological Resources, Incheon (NIBR) was re-examined and found to be inconclusive for taxonomic purposes because the deposited copepod material and its labelling does not correspond to the description of the species. A fundamental revision of the type material of T. denticula is required. The present account includes an indication of the intraspecific variation in the endopodal spine lengths on swimming legs 2 to 4 for all three species, which is essential for assessing the usefulness of these characters for unequivocal identification of Triconia species. The spine lengths on exopodal segments 1 and 2 on swimming legs 3 and 4 are proposed as new morphometric characters for the identification of males of Triconia species, which are otherwise very similar in morphology.

We examined shells and genitalia, and performed molecular analyses of Coccoglypta specimens from Sichuan Province, which have revealed the existence of a yet undescribed species (Coccoglypta liui Pall-Gergely, n. sp.). Based on conchological information, Coccoglypta scrobiculata does not belong to the Camaenidae Pilsbry, 1895 s.l., but to the Ariophantidae Godwin-Austen, 1883. Since the systematics of Ariophantidae is not fully resolved yet, it is difficult to place this species in an appropriate genus. The conchologically most similar species is Hemiplecta laotica (Mollendorff, 1899), therefore Coccoglypta scrobiculata is transferred to the genus Hemiplecta Albers, 1850. Eulota arbusticola chrysomphala Mollendorff, 1899 is elevated to species level, and treated as "Bradybaena" chrysomphala (Mollendorff, 1899), because its shell differs considerably from that of Bradybaena arbusticola (Deshayes, 1870). Bradybaena arbusticola, Satsuma leprosula (Heude, 1885) and Helix billiana Heude, 1882 are assigned to Coccoglypta based on their mamillated sculpture.

The new species can be distinguished from other known congeners by mitochondrial divergence and morphological characteristics including: (1) medium body size, SVL 70.6-72.3 mm in adult females; (2) skin smooth over the entire body; (3) absence of dorsolateral fold; (4) tympanum small, edge indistinct, less than half of eye diameter; (5) vomerine teeth in two short oblique; (6) circummarginal and transverse grooves absent on disk of the first finger; (7) presence of inner metacarpal tubercle; (8) toes fully webbed, webbing formula I 0 - 0(-) II 0 - 1/2 III0 - 1(+) IV 1(+) - 0 V; (9) absence of outer metatarsal tubercle and tarsal glands; (10) tibiotarsal articulation of the hind limb reaches posterior corners of the eye; (11) dorsum yellow-green, with irregular dark brown blotches without margins; (12) blotches concentrated on the dorsum, less on the flanks. In morphology, Amolops pallasitatus sp. nov. is similar to A. himalayanus and A. formosus, the difference between them is length of hind limbs, web of toe and dorsal colour pattern. The systematic placement of the new species within the genus is unresolved and it is not assigned to any recognized species group, for the lack of convictive evidences.

In this paper we describe the moth assemblage of the Acer-dominated forest of the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Monte Sparviere, southern Italy, where probably the highest diversity of maple species (6) is hosted at national level. We settled up ten monitoring sites, representative of the habitat complexity of the area, where moths were sampled monthly from March to November 2017. We found 371 species of Macroheterocera, among which tree-feeding species (in the larval stage) were particularly abundant and the presumably Acer-feeding Nothocasis rosariae was dominant. Despite a great homogeneity among individual species assemblages (the 26 most abundant species shared by all sites), the quantitative analysis of samples clearly separated pure Acer forests from mixed and Alnus forests, highlighting the importance of quantitative data for improving the use of nocturnal Lepidoptera as bioindicators. The richness of species at their boundary range and of conservation concern, make this area one of the most important for the conservation of Lepidoptera in southern Italy.

A morphological phylogeny and biogeographical analysis of the genus are also presented. Isostenosmylus is recovered as a monophyletic genus and species are divided in two main clades (named here as 'bifurcatus' and 'pulverulentus' clades); the greatest diversity of this genus is located in the Andean mountain range, where new studies should be focused on.

The new species is characterised by 476-659 mu m long females, lip region broad and continuous with body contour, two weak lateral bands barely visible in lateral view and cross section, needle-like stylet with its conus forming ca 50% of the total length and with a very narrow lumen in the shaft, excretory pore located just opposite the metacorpus base or slightly posterior, a dense (sclerotised) mass just anterior to the vagina, a short post-uterine sac 5-7 mu m long, elongate conoid distal body region ending in a long filiform part, males common with a dorsally convex conical tail ending to a filiform tip, 7-8 mu m long spicules with a small projection at the capitulum close to the condylus, its tip posteriorly bent, and five precloacal + caudal papillae. Based upon morphological similarities and phylogenetic affinities, it is similar to six known species of the genus, namely: E. attenuata, E. caspiensis, E. fuchsi, E. kelardashtensis, E. musae, and E. ruehmi. Ektaphelenchoides caspiensis is typologically most similar to the new species and can be separated based on vulval position, excretory pore position and male tail characters. The next most similar species, E. kelardashtensis, has a longer stylet and posteriorly located excretory pore. Comparisons with the other aforementioned species and typologically similar species under Seinura are also discussed. Molecular phylogenetic analyses were performed using Bayesian inference (BI) based upon two partial small and large subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU and LSU rDNA D2-D3) sequences and the phylogenetic affinities of the new species in both phylogenies were discussed.

Both of the recovered populations were characterised using morphological (light and scanning electron microscopy), morphometric and molecular data based upon small, partial large and internal transcribed spacer 1 ribosomal RNA (SSU, LSU D2-D3, ITS1 rDNA) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c subunit oxidase I (COI mtDNA) gene sequences. The first examined population, recovered from Gorgan, was mainly characterised by having 34-39 retrorse body annuli 11-16 mu m thick at mid-body with crenate, dentate and lobulate margins, longitudinal cuticular scratches on entire body on both lateral regions, sometimes one or two anastomoses along the body, a single labial annulus with smooth margin and smaller than the first body annulus, four distinct submedian lobes, simple open vulva with no overhang, and a terminal anus. This population was almost identical to Neolobocriconema iranense, a close examination of a topotype population recovered in this study confirming that they were conspecific. The second population, L. nokandense n. sp., was recovered from the Nokandeh and looked similar to the first population but was morphologically separated from it by a slightly crenate labial annulus under SEM (vs smooth), longer tail (13-21 vs 6-10 mu m) and smaller ratio c (23.6-32.4 vs 44.7-86.0). In molecular phylogenetic analyses, the two populations formed a clade in both SSU and LSU phylogenies. In ITS1 and COI phylogenies, the Nokandeh population (the new species) formed a separate sister clade to the N. iranense clade. Detailed observations using SEM data revealed a small annulus between the submedian lobes and the single labial annulus, an open vulva and a slightly ornamented cuticle in all three studied populations (the newly recovered populations from Golestan and the topotype population of N. iranense from Mazandaran province and the new species), corroborating their placement under Lobocriconema. As a result, N. iranense was transferred to Lobocriconema as L. iranense n. comb. (= N. iranense). The new species was morphologically compared with its close relatives L. iranense n. comb., L. pauperum, L. incrassatum, and L. nasuense, all of which having the aforementioned small annulus between the submedian lobes and the first labial annulus. The phylogeny of the genus is discussed.

It is described herein as Ficophagus curtipes n. sp. and is differentiated from all currently described species in the genus by the possession of a spicule with a ventrally recurved tip (terminal barb). It is further characterised by possessing a short post-uterine sac, an ovoid spermatheca, presence of crustaformeria, excretory pore located near the head, amoeboid sperm, three pairs of subventral papillae on the male tail, rounded male tail tip without mucron, rose-thorn-shaped spicules without cucullus and absence of gubernaculum (= apophysis). Ficophagus curtipes n. sp. was differentiated from other sequenced species by the partial small subunit rRNA gene and D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit rRNA gene. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that F. curtipes n. sp. has a closer relationship with F. benjamina and F. microcarpus in the same highly supported monophyletic clade than to the other sequenced Ficophagus and Schistonchus s.l. species.

The present study describes the infection of the skeletal musculature by Kudoa sp. in two sea catfish species, Cathorops spixii (Agassiz, 1829) and Cathorops agassizii (Eigenmann & Eigenmann, 1888), captured monthly in an estuary of the municipality of Vigia de Nazare, in Para, northern Brazil between March, 2015, and August, 2016. The morphological features of the spores are described, and the influence of the seasonal variation on the occurrence of the parasite is discussed. The specimens were taken to the laboratory for analysis using a hand lens and light microscopy. When parasites were identified in the musculature, small fragments of the tissue were removed for histological processing and staining by the Hematoxylin-Eosin, Ziehl-Neelsen, May Grunwald-Giemsa, and Gomori techniques. The pseudocysts were found in the muscle fibers, and the spores were star-shaped with elongated extremities and 4 piriform/rounded polar capsules of equal size. No infections were observed in the fish specimens collected during the rainy season, whereas all (100%) of the Cathorops specimens examined during the dry season were infected. This indicates that the ecology and infection patterns of the parasite (identified as a species of the genus Kudoa, on the basis of its morphological features) is influenced by salinity levels.

The anatomy of an unstable node: a Levantine relict precipitates phylogenomic dissolution of higher-level relationships of the armoured harvestmen (Arachnida: Opiliones: Laniatores)	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						Assamioidea; Grassatores; Haasus; Petrobunidae; Phalangodidae; Proscotolemon; Pyramidopidae	MISSING DATA; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; MOLECULAR MARKERS; TREE; GENE; INFERENCE; CONFLICT; ANCIENT; TOOL; PHYLOGENETICS	After tumultuous revisions to the family-level systematics of Laniatores (the armored harvestmen), the basally branching family Phalangodidae presently bears a disjunct and irregular distribution, attributed to the fragmentation of Pangea. One of the curious lineages assigned to Phalangodidae is the monotypic Israeli genus Haasus, the only Laniatores species that occurs in Israel, and whose presence in the Levant has been inferred to result from biogeographic connectivity with Eurasia. Recent surveys of Israeli caves have also yielded a new troglobitic morphospecies of Haasus. Here, we describe this new species as Haasus naasane sp. nov. So as to test the biogeographic affinity of Haasus, we sequenced DNA from both species and RNA from Haasus naasane sp. nov., to assess their phylogenetic placement. Our results showed that the new species is clearly closely related to Haasus judaeus, but Haasus itself is unambiguously nested within the largely Afrotropical family Pyramidopidae. In addition, the Japanese `phalangodid' Proscotolemon sauteri was recovered as nested within the Southeast Asian family Petrobunidae. Phylogenomic placement of Haasus naasane sp. nov. in a 1550-locus matrix indicates that Pyramidopidae has an unstable position in the tree of Laniatores, with alternative partitioning of the matrix recovering high nodal support for mutually exclusive tree topologies. Exploration of phylogenetic signal showed the cause of this instability to be a considerable conflict between partitions, suggesting that the basal phylogeny of Laniatores may not yet be stable to addition of taxa. We transfer Haasus to Pyramidopidae (new familial assignment). Additionally, we transfer Proscotolemon to the family Petrobunidae (new familial assignment). Future studies on basal Laniatores phylogeny should emphasise the investigation of small-bodied and obscure groups that superficially resemble Phalangodidae.

Two new species of the Australian endemic plant bug genus Myrtlemiris Cheng, Mututantri & Cassis (Heteroptera: Miridae: Orthotylinae: Orthotylini) are described as new to science: Myrtlemiris kararensis, sp. nov., and M. lochada, sp. nov. The new Australian genus and species Neomyrtlemiris picta gen. nov. et sp. nov. are also described. Myrtlemiris is analysed phylogenetically using 32 morphology-based characters, as well as molecular alignments (COI, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA; including 1958 base pairs) with the genus found to be monophyletic based on molecular, morphological and combined analyses. Neomyrtlemiris is the sister to Myrtlemiris. Host plant association analysis demonstrated constraints to the myrtaceous tribe Chamelaucieae, with Malleostemon and Calytrix recovered as ancestral host plants. Ancestral state reconstructions were carried out on male genitalic structures, demonstrating the phylogenetic value of endosomal spicules. This work demonstrates that the Orthotylinae are a rich component of Australia's biodiversity, particularly in the south-west of Western Australia.

The new species was characterised morphologically and molecularly. Important morphological details were elucidated by SEM photographs. The new species is characterised by an uninterrupted rounded cephalic disc, en face showing a rectangular labial plate with slit-like oral apertures, labial plate surrounded by slightly elevated projections resembling rudimentary lobes, R = 66 (64-69), Rex = 21 (17-24), stylet 74 (67-81) mu m long, excretory pore located at the base of the pharyngeal bulb, vulva open, tail short and conoid with a lobed terminus. The species belongs to the group 1 lip pattern. Morphologically, it is most similar to D. discolabia, D. mauritiensis, D. mineira and D. perseae. This is the first new Discocriconemella species described from China. Phylogenetic analyses based on analysis of the D2-D3 expansion segments of the 28S rRNA, ITS rRNA, partial 18S rRNA, and COI gene revealed that the new species formed a separate clade from other criconematid species, thereby supporting its status as a new species of the genus. The new species showed close relationships with Criconemoides informis.

SP; PINE WOOD; PARASITES; APHELENCHOIDIDAE; COLEOPTERA; FORESTS; PLANT; BIOLOGY; SPP.	Bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) have a significant economic impact on forest stands and agricultural settings in Israel. We focus on nematodes associated with bark beetles collected from different host plants attacked by Scolytinae. The sampling was conducted in forest plantations and fruit tree orchards in several areas in Israel. A total of 430 beetle specimens of eight species were examined for the presence of nematodes. Fifteen nematode species were detected and identified based on molecular and morphological characteristics. Among the examined scolytids, the pine bark beetle, Orthotomicus erosus, the most widely distributed and frequently occurring species in Israel, was accompanied by the highest nematode diversity, with 11 species recovered. Nematode associations with the almond bark beetle (Scolytus amygdali), the olive bark beetle (Phloeotribus scarabaeoides) and the fig bark beetle (Hypoborus ficus) were recorded for the first time. Our study thus supplies novel information on scolytid-associated nematodes in Israel.

Hoplolaimus smokyensis n. sp. is a new species of lance nematode collected in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. Females of H. smokyensis n. sp. have a labial region characterised by six, occasionally five, annules. The basal lip annule is subdivided by about 24 longitudinal striae. The stylet averages 47 mu m long with robust, tulip-shaped stylet knobs bearing anterior projections. The hemizonid is ca 4 mu m anterior to the excretory pore. The lateral field is incompletely areolated and has four continuous incisures from the metacorpus region to the tail region. There are three pharyngeal gland nuclei. Vulval epiptygma are absent. The scutellate phasmids are located one anterior and one posterior to the vulva. The male is shorter than the female and the head region is higher and more rounded than that of the female. The bursa extends to the tail tip and the gubernaculum is large and protrusible and has titillae and a capitulum. Morphologically, H. smokyensis n. sp. is most similar to H. galeatus and H. stephanus, but can be distinguished by differences such as the number of annules and longitudinal striae on the lip region and morphometric values. Hoplolaimus smokyensis n. sp. is also genetically distinct from other species according to comparisons of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analyses based on ribosomal and mitochondrial gene sequences suggest that H. smokyensis n. sp. is a lineage distinct from related Hoplolaimus species.

Miculenchus brevisalvus n. sp., the first new species, is mainly characterised by its short females 334-388 mu m long and with a short 6.0-7.5 mu m long stylet, pyriform to pyriform-elongate pharyngeal bulb, 4-8 mu m long post-uterine sac (PUS), offset rounded spermatheca filled with small spheroid sperm, elongate conoid tail 62-83 mu m long with a sharp tip, and males with simple cloacal lips. Miculenchus muscus n. sp., the second new species, is characterised by a combination of the following features: body 401-467 mu m long, well-developed protuberant labial plate at the anterior end under light microscopy, stylet 7-9 mu m long, pyriform pharyngeal bulb, PUS 4-9 mu m long, gradually narrowing conical tail 62-74 mu m long with a finely pointed or sharp end and bearing several fine bristles at tip, and a male with projecting cloacal lips. Both newly described species were morphologically compared with four currently known species of the genus, viz., M. elegans, M. salmae, M. salvus, and M. tesselatus. Miculenchus salmae was also recovered and reported from Iran for the first time. It is mainly characterised by lacking a PUS and the characteristic vagina shape. Miculenchus muscus n. sp. and M. salmae were both characterised using scanning electron microscopic images, yielding new morphological observations for the genus. All three species are studied for their molecular phylogenetic characters using sequences of near-full length fragments of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) and the D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LSU rDNA D2-D3). In both SSU and LSU phylogenies, all currently sequenced species of Miculenchus formed a monophyletic group with maximal clade support in both Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analysis.

Bursaphelenchus irokophilus n. sp. is based upon morphological and molecular characters and is characterised by the two-lined lateral field, mitten-shaped spicule possessing cucullus and well-developed and slightly dorsally curved condylus with narrowly rounded tip, female vulva with side flap, and long, smoothly tapering and strongly ventrally recurved female tail. The new species belongs to the abietinus-group and is similar to, but distinguished from, B. abietinus and B. rainulfi by the position of secretory-excretory pore, longer and slender female tail and some morphometric values. In addition, the phylogeny based on SSU and D2-D3 LSU regions shows that this species belongs to the abietinus-group, the relationship among the species of this group being discussed.

In this study, we provide morphological and molecular characterisation of seven populations of C. pestis and eight species of Paratylenchus recovered from north-western Iran. A total of 26 new sequences of D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rRNA and ITS rRNA were obtained and used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Results of phylogenetic analyses revealed that the subfamilies of Tylenchulidae form well-separated clades, but that the genera Cacopaurus and Paratylenchus (= Gracilacus) in the subfamily Paratylenchinae are clustered in one clade. It appears that the previously used character of "stylet length greater than 40 mu m" is not homologous and evolved more than once within the Paratylenchinae.

This species is medium (34-35mm SVL) in size and can be differentiated from all other Sri Lankan congeners by a suite of distinct morphometric, meristic, and color characters. The species is recorded from rock outcrop habitats in wet, cool, and shady forest with minimal anthropogenic disturbance at low-elevations (below 860 m). Existing data suggest this gecko is a point endemic. Being a rupicolous microhabitat specialist with a scansorial mode of life, this species is susceptible to both localized and widespread threats. Therefore, isolated forest patches warrant special conservation action, including habitat protection, in-depth research, and species-specific hands-on management practices.

Serious population declines and loss of urodelan diversity may occur if appropriate action is not taken to mitigate against the further spread and impact of Bsal. We provide an overview of several potential mitigation methods, and describe their possible advantages and limitations. We conclude that long-term, context-dependent, multi-faceted approaches are needed to successfully mitigate adverse effects of Bsal, and that these approaches should be initiated pre-arrival of the pathogen. The establishment of ex situ assurance colonies, or management units, for species threatened with extinction, should be considered as soon as possible. While ex situ conservation and preventive measures aimed at improving biosecurity by limiting amphibian trade may be implemented quickly, major challenges that lie ahead are in designing in situ disease containment and mitigation post-arrival and in increasing public awareness.

The spores of the microsporidian pathogen were slightly curved in shape, and measured 2.44-3.55 mu m in length and 1.25-1.55 mu m in width (n = 50). Its ultrastructure is characteristic of monokaryotic groups. All lifecycle stages of the pathogen, including meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts, and mature spores, are monokaryotic. The spore has 6-8 windings of the polar filament. Morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the lifecycle stages place it within the family Unikaryonidae. However, the phylogenetic tree constructed on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicates that the pathogen is closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha Glade of microsporidia. Therefore, we have classified the microsporidian of C. aurata in the tentative group Microsporidium in order to avoid creating an unnecessary or incorrect new genus/species.

The new species are in transitional position between Noteolethaeus Woodward et Slater, 1962 and Sweetolethaeus Slater, 1972, rendering the genus-level differentiation of the above two genera impossible. However, because the type species of the two genera are rather dissimilar, Sweetolethaeus is retained as subgenus of Noteolethaeus (stat. n.). The following new combinations are accordingly proposed: Noteolethaeus (Sweetolethaeus) macchiaensis (Slater, 1972), comb. n. and Noteolethaeus (Sweetolethaeus) termiticolus (Slater, 1972), comb. n.

This new species is distinguished from other species of Dendropsophus by its small size (SVL 18.7-21.1 mm in adult males and 19.6-23.2 mm in females); in life, dorsal ground coloration brown, with two anterior parallel and straight, dark brown stripes and a middorsal sacral stripe; and lateral limits of dorsal coloration above tympanum. In addition, the new species differs from all other species of the D. rubicundulus group (along with D. anataliasiasi) by having a composite advertisement call, i.e., a series of calls consisting of two call types. In a phylogenetic tree based on 494 bp of the 16S mitochondrial gene, four species of Dendropsophus, D. cruzi, D. juliani, and D. sanborni and one candidate species, D. juliani A, are positioned within the rubicundulus species group which poses questions on the monophyly of this group as well as its morphological definition. The occurrence of both single and composite calls in the D. rubicundulus group suggests future studies on the call evolution in that group as well as the whole genus.

Integrative taxonomy reveals six new species of day geckos of the genus Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 (Reptilia: Squamata: Gekkonidae) from geographically-isolated hill forests in Sri Lanka	VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Anthropogenic threats; biogeography; conservation; endangered species; granite caves; microhabitat; natural history; mtDNA; morphology; point endemic; systematics; wildlife	BENT-TOED GECKOS; WESTERN-GHATS; SAURIA GEKKONIDAE; NATURAL-HISTORY; SP NOV.; CONSERVATION; PHYLOGENY; SYSTEMATICS; REDESCRIPTION; BOULENGER	Six new day gecko species of the genus Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 are described from geographically isolated forested hills (Bambarabotuwa, Kadugannawa, Kokagala, Kudumbigala, Maragala and Walapane) in Sri Lanka based on analyses of morphological and molecular traits. We provide an updated mtDNA-based genealogy of Sri Lankan Cnemaspis and provide further evidence that diversity of the genus in the island may still be underestimated. The six new Cnemaspis species described herein are small to medium (27-40 mm SVL) in size and can be differentiated from all other Sri Lankan congeners by a suite of distinct morphometric, meristic and molecular characteristics. They are recorded from wet, cool, spacious granite caves found within rock outcrops embedded in forests distributed across low and mid-elevations (similar to 25-600 m) with minimal anthropogenic disturbance. Existing data suggest that each of these geckos have a highly restricted (point endemic) distribution ranges. Further, their area of occurrence, extent of distribution, and relative a abundance appear to be low, thus all these species are categorized as Critically Endangered (CR) under IUCN Red List criteria. With the descriptions of these species, the number of Cnemaspis described from Sri Lanka increases to 32, all of which are endemic to the island. The discovery of these new species highlights the understudied diversity of geckos in isolated hills. Being rupicolous microhabitat specialists with a scansorial mode of life, these species are susceptible to both localized and widespread threats. Therefore, isolated hill forests of Sri Lanka, especially in the intermediate and dry zones, warrant special conservation, habitat protection, indepth research and specific management actions.

Three new species of Austrochaperina from southern Papua New Guinea (Anura, Microhylidae)	VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Amphibia; Melanesia; systematics; bioacoustics; morphology; rainforest	FROGS AMPHIBIA; PHYLOGENY	We describe three new species in the microhylid frog genus Austrochaperina Fry, 1912 from southern Papua New Guinea. All three species are medium sized for the genus (between 23-31 mm SUL) and exhibit no or limited sexual dimorphism. Austrochaperina beehleri sp. nov. can be distinguished from all congeners by, among other characters, having the dorsal surfaces in life reddish with brown mottling, while the surfaces of the axilla, groin, knee pit and posterior thigh are orange. It produces 50 -70 unpulsed advertisement calls in series lasting 8-12 s. Austrochaperina fulva sp. nov. can be distinguished from all congeners by, among other characters, having the dorsum in life reddish-brown to brown without mottling, the lateral surfaces yellowish to reddish, and the ventral surfaces largely yellow. It utters distinctly pulsed advertisement calls in very long series, one series lasting more than 25 s. Austrochaperina brachypus sp. nov. can be distinguished from all congeners by, among other characters, having very short legs, having the dorsum in preservative uniform brown becoming lighter on the flanks, and the abdomen, chest and ventral surfaces of the limbs cream with fine brown markings that are most dense on the throat. It utters unpulsed advertisement calls in short series lasting just 1-2 s. Like most other members of the genus these species were encountered most commonly on the forest floor, although two of them appear to be at least partially scansorial. Descriptions of these three species brings the number of Austrochaperina known from the New Guinea region to at least 25.

DNA sequences were obtained from six species of Lynceus using freshly collected specimens from Europe, North America, South America, and Australia and combined with GenBank sequences from previous studies. Specimens of the new species were collected from a pool on the Huentelauquen Plains near Huentelauquen City. Our molecular analyses placed L. huentelauquensis, sp. nov. within Lynceus and close to a cluster of Australian species, and revealed morphological misidentifications, cross-contamination, or incorrect upload in earlier GenBank sequences. L. huentelauquensis, sp. nov. is separated from other Lynceus primarily by the morphology of the rostrum and the male claspers. L. huentelauquensis, sp. nov. is the first described laevicaudatan from Chile, the sixth from South America, and the 13th from the Americas. The morphology of laevicaudatans from the Americas is reviewed and an updated key to the (male) Lynceidae of the region is provided. Our study highlights the necessity of a revision of Laevicaudata using multiple genetic markers as well as thorough morphological studies on a greater number of taxa. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:9A783D96-B270-40DF-8361-11BA063C9A0	[Sigvardt, Zandra M.

Here wereconstruct the evolutionary relationshipsof the herophile group and describe five new species from Cuba: Calisto gundlachi sp. nov., Calisto siguanensis sp. nov., Calisto disjunctus sp. nov., Calisto sharkeyae sp. nov. and Calisto lastrai sp. nov.We employ one mitochondrial and four nuclear markers to assess the phylogenetic position, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference approaches, of the new taxa. Our phylogenetic trees yielded two strongly supported main clades with four of the new species included within them and C. sharkeyae as sister group to the rest of the major main clade. We conduct time-divergence estimations and ancestral area reconstructions using BEAST and BioGeoBEARS. The group originated 12.15 million years ago during the middle Miocene in north-eastern Cuba, Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa Massif. After 6 million years of in situ evolution most lineages started to colonise other Cuban territories and the Bahamas. This scenario is consistent with key geological events, including the closure of the western Havana-Matanzas channel 8-6 million years ago, the uplift of the Sierra Maestra 6-5 million years ago, and the land connections among Cuban regions during the Miocene-Pleistocene sea level drops. Dispersal and vicariance processes may have occurred, with populations surviving floodings on the major and minor mountain ranges, which remained as islands'. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:03690F79-F938-42A0-B234-4A228D5C1913	[Nunez, Rayner; Hausmann, Axel] SNSB Bavarian State Collect Zool, Sect Lepidoptera, D-81247 Munich, Germany; [Barro-Canamero, Alejandro] Univ La Habana, Fac Biol, 25 Esq 1,Vedado,Plaza La Revoluc, Havana 10400, Cuba; [Minno, Marc C.] 600 NW 35th Terrace, Gainesville, FL 32607 USA; [Fernandez, Douglas M.] 1B 61 e-2Da & 3Ra, Camaguey 71100, Cuba	Nunez, R (reprint author), SNSB Bavarian State Collect Zool, Sect Lepidoptera, D-81247 Munich, Germany.	raynernunez75@gmail.com			Systematic Research Foundation; Georg Foster Research Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation [1162549-CUB-GFHERMESE]; TREE Institute International	We thank Jeobel L.

The new species differs from other Labrys species by a combination of several morphometric and morphological characters: vulva-anus distance 66-74 mu m, tail length 172-182 mu m, post-uterine sac 11-12 mu m, excretory duct less sclerotised, and hexagon-shaped labial disc. The novelty of L. fuzhouensis sp. n. is also confirmed by multidimensional scaling analysis. The 18S and 28S rRNA-based phylogenies suggest that the new species nested in the Labrys clade as sister to L. chinensis. In addition to the new species description, Coslenchus rafiqi is reported from China for the first time, the description being supplemented by the first molecular data (18S and 28S rRNA) for this species.

The combination of morphological analyses and molecular analyses based on D2-D3 of 28S rDNA, ITS rDNA, and COI mtDNA regions supported the establishment of a new Pratylenchus species, making a total of 103 valid Pratylenchus species. The females of P. horti n. sp. are characterised by the following traits: low labial region with two annuli continuous to the body, en face form belonging to group II sensu Corbett & Clark (1983) with submedian triangular-shaped segments fused with the oral disc and separated from the lateral segments, lateral field with four incisures at vulval level and lacking areolation, robust stylet 15-17 mu m long with rounded knobs, and subcylindrical tail with smooth tail tip. The males are largely similar to the females but differ from the females by the partially areolated lateral field, slightly ventrally arcuate and weakly cephalated spicules (15-19 mu m), and ventrally curved elongate conical tail with a poorly protruding, crenate bursa. The new species was recovered from soil and root samples from the rhizosphere of Hedychium greenii growing in the Botanical Garden, Ghent University, Belgium.

Preliminary morphological studies led to the identification of the species as H. rosae. Further morphological and morphometric characterisation of the species was carried out by light microscopy. The gross morphology was consistent with the description of H. rosae except for some deviations in measurements. Here we present an amended description of the species together with illustrations and additional morphometric and morphological characters. The diagnostic relationship of H. rosae is given based on morphological and molecular information and a comparative study of paratype and holotype females. In addition, ITS rRNA and D2-D3 sequences were used for the construction of evolutionary relationship by Bayesian inference. The present study provides molecular data and a redescription of H. rosae collected from the rhizosphere of sugarcane in India.

SP; POPULATIONS; EXPANSION; CEREALS; THORNEI; GENES; SPP.	A Pratylenchus species identified during a survey of Pratylenchus quasitereoides incidence at four locations of the grainbelt of Western Australia is described. Morphological and morphometric features indicated the previously undescribed morphotypes in nematode mixtures encountered were conspecific to P. curvicauda, and were clearly distinguishable from nine common Pratylenchus spp. Typical features of P. curvicauda were its body length (415-540 mu m), which was curved to a c-shaped with a maximum body diameter of 20 mu m, and the nature of its tail; 34 mu m long, 2.8 mu m wide at the anus and a typical ventrally arcuate with a round terminus. Sequenced for the first time, the sequences of the partial 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-partial 28S (80 clones, 14 individual nematodes) and the 28S-D3 (17 clones) regions of the rDNA of P. curvicauda had overall mean distances of 0.013 and 0.085, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses with sequences of both segments of the rDNA clearly showed the P. curvicauda isolates as monophyletic, distinct from ca 40 Pratylenchus species. Notably, it was distinct from Pratylenchus species present in Australia including P. quasitereoides and a Western Australia isolate of P. thomei. Further research into the biology of P. curvicauda is needed to facilitate development of strategies for its management, if it is an important pest.

Based on morphological and molecular analyses, the species were identified as Xiphinema histriae and Xiphinema lapidosum, being this the first record and molecular characterization of both species in Spain. The morphometrics and morphology of the Spanish populations agree with those of the original description and paratype specimens and the present study provided a first description of the second to fourth juvenile stages of both species. A detailed study on the morphology in the Spanish populations of X. histriae, as well as in paratypes, showed a pseudo Z-organ with weakly muscularized wall and containing numerous small dense granular bodies, which was different to the original description by Lambert' et al. (1993). This new finding suggests that X. histriae must be considered a member of the morphospecies Group 5 of X. non-americanum. Phylogenetic analysis based on D2 to D3 expansion segments of 28S gene, ITS1 and partial Coxl gene indicated that X. histriae and X. lapidosum are phylogenetically related with other Xiphinema non-americanum group spp. reported from Spain. Considering the pathological and economic importance of this group of nematodes, the combination of morphological characters, measurements, and molecular analysis is crucial for accurate identification of these species.

The specimens were collected in October 2014, near the village of Rossano Calabro (Southern Italy, Ionian Sea), and in July 2016 off the village of Scilla (Southern Italy, Tyrrhenian Sea), from 6 to 38 m depth. Protodorvillea artemidis sp. nov. is characterised by four eyes, two short clavate antennae, dorsal and ventral cirri from the first parapodium, a long subacicular falciger reminiscent of that of Dorvillea, and the simultaneous occurrence of supraacicular and subacicular cultriform chaetae with serrated edges. Protodorvillea artemidis sp. nov. is similar to P. kefersteini (McIntosh, 1869) but differs from this species mainly by morphological characteristics of prostomium, mouth parts, and supraacicular and subacicualar chaetae. Morphological characters important for differentiation of the new species herein described from congeneric species are discussed. The description of P. artemidis sp. nov. helps to improve the knowledge on the diversity of Mediterranean invertebrates, and specifically on the family Dorvilleidae, which is still poorly known and includes many opportunistic species, early indicators of pollution.

Dactyloidae; Mexico; new species; Guerrero; Reptilia; Squamata	COMPLEX SQUAMATA; CLASSIFICATION; INFERENCE; PHYLOGENY; REVISION; LIZARDS; MRBAYES; CLADE; TREE	We describe the new species Norops brianjuliani sp. nov. from the Pacific versant of southern. Mexico. Norops briunjulluni differs from all congeners by having a combination of (1) smooth ventral scales; (2) usually a patch of three greatly enlarged supraocular scales; (3) moderately long hind legs, longest toe of adpressed hind leg reaching to a point between posterior and anterior levels of eye, ratio shank length/snoui-vent length 0.24-0.26; (4) a pair of greatly enlarged postcloacal scales in males; (5) 10 to 12 row's of greatly enlarged, keeled middorsal scales; and (6) a large pink dewlap in -males. In external morphology, N. brianjuliani is most similar to N, lioguster front which it differs by having larger middorsal scales (more than three times the size of granular flank scales in. N. brianjuliani vs. less than three times in N. liogaster). Also, in a preliminary molecular genetic analysis, N. brianjuliuni has a genetic distance of 8.7% (16S) and 15.3% (COI), respectively, from N. liogaster.

Multidisciplinary investigation on the catfish parasite Hamatopeduncularia Yamaguti, 1953 (Monogenoidea: Dactylogyridae): description of two new species from India, and phylogenetic considerations	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Hamatopeduncularia arii; Hamatopeduncularia bifida sp. nov.; Hamatopeduncularia elongatum; Hamatopeduncularia madhaviae sp. nov.; Hamatopeduncularia thalassini	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; RIBOSOMAL DNA; MONOGENEANS PLATYHELMINTHES; FRESH-WATER; FISHES; ANCYROCEPHALIDAE; CILIOPHORA; SILURIFORMES; GILLS; IDENTIFICATION	Hamatopeduncularia was erected with Hamatopeduncularis arii as the type species. This genus comprises monogenoidean species mostly found as ectoparasites of marine catfishes belonging to the Ariidae. There is a significant taxonomic ambiguity among Hamatopeduncularia species due to their morphological similarity, but so far only a few morphological studies have succeeded in addressing interspecific variation and relationships. Moreover, little molecular data is available for this genus. A multidisciplinary, integrated study consisting of morphological, morphometric and molecular analyses was conducted on different species of Hamatopeduncularia recovered from the gills of two marine catfishes, Arius jella Day and Plicofollis dussumieri (Valenciennes). Five species of Hamatopeduncularia, two of which represent new species, were investigated: H. arii, H. elongatum, H. thalassini, H. madhaviae sp. nov. and H. bifida sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the 18S rDNA sequence as a molecular marker. The most important results of the present work are: (1) the multidisciplinary description of two novel species; (2) the multidisciplinary redescription of two species and of the type species of the genus; (3) the first molecular characterisation of 18S rDNA sequences of five species of genus Hamatopeduncularia; and (4) molecular support for the monophyly of the genus.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:1333F4CC-E497-4D0A-AD7D-276D44AE6413http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:43D18F75-6F4A-4F9B-8C00-6234E5BA6526	[Illa, K.; Shameem, U.; Mangam, S.] Andhra Univ, Dept Zool, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Serra, V; Melai, M.; Petroni, G.; Modeo, L.] Univ Pisa, Dept Biol, Pisa, Italy; [Basuri, C.

Cephalotrichella echinicola, sp. nov. (Palaeonemertea:Cephalotrichellidae), a new nemertean associated with sea urchins from Nha Trang Bay (South China Sea)	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						Nemertea; confocal microscopy; phylogenetic analysis; Metalia	DNA-SEQUENCES; ECHINODERMATA; PHYLOGENY; 18S; CARCINONEMERTIDAE; REDESCRIPTION; HOPLONEMERTEA; COMMENSAL; DISEASES; CRABS	About 50 nemertean species have been reported to live in symbiotic relationships with other invertebrates, but only two hoplonemertean species are associated with echinoderms (starfish). The palaeonemertean Cephalotrichella echinicola, sp. nov. is described from samples collected in Nha Trang Bay, Vietnam, South China Sea. The species is the first known nemertean associated with sea urchins (Metalia sternalis and M. spatagus), living on both the oral and the aboral surfaces of the host and freely moving among its spines. The internal morphology of the new species is described based on histological sections and confocal laser scanning microscopy with phalloidin and antibody labelling. Sequences of three nuclear gene markers (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and histone H3) and two mitochondrial gene markers (16S rRNA and COI) were compared with those of other palaeonemertean species, and a phylogenetic analysis suggested that C. echinicola is closest to the free-living Cephalotrichella albaGibson & Sundberg, 1992. Both the morphological data and the phylogenetic analysis provide additional evidence for distinguishing the families Cephalotrichidae and Cephalotrichellidae and support the rejection of Cephalotrichella as a junior synonym of Cephalothrix. A new diagnosis of the genus Cephalotrichella is given. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:091B5D56-71B2-4F4C-9AD8-F666B4610DE2	[Chernyshev, Alexei V.; Polyakova, Neonila] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, Natl Sci Ctr Marine Biol, Vladivostok 690041, Russia; [Chernyshev, Alexei V.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Vladivostok 690600, Russia; [Britayev, Temir A.; Bratova, Olga A.; Mekhova, Elena S.] Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Leninsky Pr 33, Moscow 129164, Russia	Chernyshev, AV (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, Natl Sci Ctr Marine Biol, Vladivostok 690041, Russia.; Chernyshev, AV (reprint author), Far Eastern Fed Univ, Vladivostok 690600, Russia.	nemertea1969@gmail.com			Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-50-00034]; Coastal Branch of the Russian-Vietnamese Tropical Centre	The genetic investigations were supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 14-50-00034).

Twigs that are not twigs: phylogenetic placement of crab spiders of the genus Tmarus of Sri Lanka with comments on the higher-level phylogeny of Thomisidae	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						biodiversity; cryptic behaviour; evolution; hotspot; laterigrade; mimicry; systematics	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; TAXONOMIC REVISION; ARACHNIDA ARANEAE; SIMON; EPICADUS; BLOCKS; GENERA	Sri Lankan species of the genus Tmarus are cryptic spiders that live either on greenish moss-covered twigs or brownish dried-out twigs. They have remained taxonomically unrevised. The only known species was misplaced in Peritraeus Simon, 1895, which has never been subjected to phylogenetic evaluation. The present study is designed to investigate the phylogenetic placement of Sri Lankan Tmarus within Thomisidae as well as to assess the validity of Peritraeus and its relationship to Tmarus and Monaeses, if any. Using a multilocus molecular dataset (16S-ND1, 28S, CO1 and H3) we provide evidence that Tmarus and Monaeses are paraphyletic and that Peritraeus is a junior subjective synonym of Tmarus. Four species of Tmarus, including three new species, are now recorded from Sri Lanka. The legacy groups Alcimochthae and Tmarae are confirmed to be polyphyletic. Further, the following new species are described: Tmarus hiyarensis, sp. nov., T. viridomaculatus, sp. nov. and T. manojkaushalyai sp. nov. The following new combination is proposed: Tmarus hystrix (Simon, 1895), comb. nov. (this results in a homonym with Tmarus hystrix Caporiacco, 1954: we rename the species Tmarus caporioccoi Ileperuma Arachchi & Benjamin, replacement name).

The new species has a body length of 803-1053 mu m (females n = 10) and 620 and 739 mu m (males n = 2). The cuticle is weakly annulated with four lateral lines. Cephalic region is annulated and continuous with body contour. The stylet is 8.0 to 9.0 mu m long with asymmetrical knobs. Esophageal basal bulb is present with a small posterior extension projecting into the intestine. Excretory pore is situated at the level of esophageal basal bulb region. Post-uterine sac is 5 to 8 mu m long and uterus is without diverticulum. Tails of both sexes are similar, short and sub-cylindrical. Males have 24 to 25 mu m long bursa leptoderan and spicules 24 or 25 mu m long. A non-branching oviduct is present to form a uterine diverticulum; the new species is closely related to five known species of the genus, namely P. asymmetrica, P. balochistanica, P. densa, P. iranica and P. niger. It most closely resembles P. iranica, but differs from it morphologically by a shorter stem-like extension projecting into lumen of intestine and male with sub-cylindrical tail vs conoid. In addition to morphological comparisons, the molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 733 bp of the partial sequence of 28S D2/D3 expansion segments of the large subunit rDNA gene (LSU) revealed this as a new species.

For the first time, 28S rDNA sequences are reported for H. canadensis and H. varicaudatus, whereas new mtCOI sequences were acquired for all three analyzed species. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the 28S rDNA fragments revealed that H. canadensis and H. varicaudatus are members of a clade that is a sister group to all other Helicotylenchus species; however, the closest known sister group to H. canadensis is H. vulgaris type A. Both 28S rDNA-and mtCOI-based phylogenetic results suggest that this clade excludes H. pseudorobustus, whose most recent common ancestor with the former species was inferred to be the ancestor of all Helicotylenchus species. Moreover, within the mtCOI sequences obtained from H. pseudorobustus, unlike from the other two, a simultaneous presence of TAG and TAA codons was identified. This may indicate alterations are needed in the mitochondrial genetic code in H. pseudorobustus or for other genomic rearrangements.

In the present study we describe Cossura yacy sp. nov. increasing to 29 the number of known Cossuridae species. We have found and analyzed 60 individuals of C. yacy sp. nov. from Sao Marcos estuarine complex (ca. 02 degrees S; 44 degrees W) around Sao Luis Harbor (Maranhao, Brazil). It differs from other species of the genus mainly by the presence of two pairs of nuchal organs at lateral margins of the peristomium, branchial filament in the median region of the third chaetiger and by short and long capillary smooth chaetae with spinulosa on the distal half. These two chaetal types are present through the body both in the neuropodia and in the notopodia. Adults specimens of the Cossura yacy sp. nov. have seven notopodial and five neuropodial chaetae in the 5th parapodium; nine notopodial and seven neuropodial chaetae in the 20th parapodium; five notopodial and six neuropodial chaetae in the 43th parapodium. Pygidium has three long anal cirri, reaching the fourth posterior segment.	[Sousa, Lorena K. S.; Cutrim, Marco V.

Lichens were sampled in two of the three protected areas of the department: Distrito de Manejo Integrado (DMI) Luriza and Reserva Forestal Protectora (RFP) El Palomar. The inventory revealed 61 species, including four new to science: Fissurina linoana Lucking, Moncada & G. Rodr. sp. nov., Graphis lurizana Lucking, Moncada & Celis sp. nov., G. mokanarum Lucking, Moncada & M.C. Martinez sp. nov., and Phaeographis galeanoae Lucking, Moncada & B. Salgado-N. sp. nov. Arthonia erupta and Coenogonium saepincola are new to South America, whereas thirteen species are recorded for Colombia for the first time. Further 37 species are new records for Atlantico, raising the total of species known from the department from 27 to 84. With 42 species at Luriza and 31 at El Palomar, species richness was comparable to that of other DTF sites in the Neotropics. Overlap in species composition between the two sites was remarkably low, with only twelve shared species (20 %), indicating a high level of heterogeneity. Biogeographical affinities lie with Central American DTF, which is in line with those of woody plants. These results underline the importance of the remaining fragments of DTF in Colombia in conserving partially unknown biodiversity and the necessity for their continuing conservation.

This species is characterized by a round-to-hexagonal labial disc, the presence of a labial region, which is continuous or slightly offset from the body with six sectors, lateral sectors of first labial annulus being smaller than the submedian sectors, the presence of six to seven labial annules; the absence of deirids; stylet length 24 to 28 mu m long, body length 776 to 979 mu m long; lateral field with six to eight lateral lines, without areolation at mid-body and with areolation in outer bands at the tail region and a pointed tail terminus. Geocenamus vietnamensis n. sp. most closely resembles G. boghiae in having a non-sclerotized head framework and lacking a bursa in the males. It can be clearly distinguished from all other species of the genus Geocenamus by these characteristics. The combination of morphology, morphometric features, and phylogenetic trees, based on D2-D3 of 28S and ITS rDNA sequences, showed that this new species can be clearly separated from all other sequenced species. This record is the first for Geocenamus in Vietnam.

The species is characterized by a medium-sized and slender body (female: L = 1.1 to 1.5 mm; a = 16.8 to 20.6; b = 5.7 to 7.1; c = 7.5 to 10.4; c' = 5.0 to 7.6; V = 45 to 51%), presence of four incisures each in the lateral fields with three minute warts, long rectum (2 to 3 anal body diameters), nine pairs of papillae arranged as 1+1+1/3+3 pattern, a prominent double-flapped epipytigma on vulval opening, presence of open leptoderan bursa and crochet needle-shaped spicules place it in the insectivore group. Morphologically, O. indicus n. sp. closely resembles O. carolinensis, O. chongmingensis, O. colombiana, and O. nadarajani. Molecular phylogenetic analysis carried out using ITS and D2/D3 expansion region of 28S rDNA sequences suggests that O. indicus n. sp. is closer to O. chongmingensis and O. rugaonensis. In summary, the morphometrical data, morphological observations and molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that O. indicus n. sp. is sufficiently different from any known species and is therefore proposed as a new species within the insectivore group.

It is described herein as Ficophagus auriculatae n. sp. and is characterised by possessing the combined characters of a short post-uterine sac, excretory pore located between the metacorpus and the stylet basal knobs, testis multi-reflexed, amoeboid sperm, three pairs of subventral papillae on male tail, rounded male tail tip without mucron, absence of gubernaculum (=apophysis) and sickle-shaped spicules with terminal cucullus. Ficophagus auriculatae n. sp. was differentiated from other sequenced species by the partial small subunit rRNA gene and D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit rRNA gene. Phylogenetic analysis with the above-mentioned sequences suggested that F. auriculatae n. sp. has a closer relationship with F. fleckeri in the same highly supported monophyletic clade than with the other sequenced Ficophagus and Schistonchus sensu lato species.

The new species is characterised by its 1.69-2.01 mm long body in females and 1.29-1.51mmin males, lip region offset by deep constriction and 15-17 mu m broad, odontostyle 27-30 mu m long, neck 340-473 mu m long, pharyngeal expansion occupying 52-54% of total neck length, uterus a simple tube-like structure 68-106 mu m long, vulva longitudinal (V = 54-59), tail short and rounded conoid (20-28 mu m, c = 54-88, c' = 0.6-0.8) with a nearly terminal projection of inner cuticle layer, spicules 60-64 mu m long, and 7-10 spaced ventromedian supplements without hiatus. SEM pictures, available for the first time for a representative of the genus, show a hexagonal (nearly hexastellate) oral field divided into six sectors by the existence of six deep incisures. Molecular analyses, also presented for the first time for a representative of the genus, results in a narrow evolutionary relationship among Chitwoodius and Tylencholaimus, and supports the monophyly of the Tylencholaimidae. This is the first record of Chitwoodius in Asian Far East territories. Chitwoodius ahmadi sp. n. is proposed for a misattributed population of C. seshadrii.

Although is recognized that bacterial biofilms play a role in this process, the responsible chemical cues are beginning to be investigated. Here, we tested the role of substrate-specific bacteria biofilms and their Quorum Sensing Signaling Molecule (QSSM) extracts on chemotaxis and settlement of larvae from Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, a hydroid that grows on gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs. We isolated and taxonomically identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, 14 bacterial strains from shells having H. symbiolongicarpus. Three isolates, Shigella flexneri, Microbacterium liquefaciens, and Kocuria erythromyxa, were identified to produce QSSMs using biosensors detecting N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones. Multispecies biofilms and QSSM extracts from these bacteria showed a positive chemotactic effect on H. symbiolongicarpus larvae, a phenomenon not observed with mutant strains of E. coli and Chromobacterium violaceum that are unable to produce QSSMs. These biofilms and QSSMs extracts induced high rates of larval attachment, although only 1 % of the attached larvae metamorphosed to primary polyps, in contrast to 99 % of larvae incubated with CsCl, an artificial inductor of attachment and metamorphosis. These observations suggest that bacterial QSSMs participate in H. symbiolongicarpus substrate selection by inducing larval chemotaxis and attachment. Furthermore, they support the notion that settlement in cnidarians is decoupled into two processes, attachment to the substrate and metamorphosis to a primary polyp, where QSSMs likely participate in the former but not in the latter.

Tropidofusus can be distinguished from both Fulgurofusus and Coluzea on the basis of its lower spire, prominent peripheral keel, long, thin siphonal canal, as well as in having a much thinner shell that lacks axial sculpture. The type species, Tropidofusus ypotethys n. sp., differs from its congeners in having a broader peripheral keel, smaller aperture and longer siphonal canal, as well as by inhabiting bathyal rather than abyssal depths. The genus is reviewed and the relationships of Tropidofusus to other supraspecific taxa within Columbariidae are discussed, as are relationships among the families within Turbinelloidea.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:3CA568AD-1B6F-4D4E-9DF7-8377CABB8553	[Harasewych, M.

The new species can be separated from P. argentinus by the armature formula in the endopod of the second to fourth swimming legs (0, 1, 021; 0, 1, 121; 0, 1, 121 in P. argentinus, but 1, 1, 221; 1, 1, 221; 1, 1, 221 in the new species), and armature complement in the third exopodal segment of the fourth swimming leg (with eight setae/spines in the new species, but seven elements in P. argentinus). The general shape and armature of the female fifth leg is similar in the two species but some minor differences in their ornamentation were observed. This is also the first record of the genus in the Mediterranean Sea and outside of the South Atlantic Ocean.

Two new Species of Pristionchus (Nematoda: Diplogastridae) include the Gonochoristic Sister Species of P. fissidentatus	JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY			English	Article						Pristionchus pacificus; P. fissidentatus; Taiwan; Japan; Scarab beetles	GENUS PRISTIONCHUS; SCARAB BEETLES; N. SP; JAPAN; COLEOPTERA; EVOLUTION; TOOL	The genus Pristionchus (Kreis, 1932) consists of more than 30 soil nematode species that are often found in association with scarab beetles. Three major radiations have resulted in the "maupasi species group" in America, the "pacificus species group" in Asia, and the "lheritieri species group," which contains species from Europe and Asia. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that a group of three species, including the gonochorists P. elegans and P. bucculentus and the hermaphrodite P. fissidentatus, is basal to the above-mentioned radiations. Two novel species are described here: Pristionchus paulseni sp. n. from Taiwan and P. yamagatae sp. n. from Japan by means of morphology, morphometrics and genome-wide transcriptome sequence analysis. Previous phylotranscriptomic analysis of the complete Pristionchus genus recognized P. paulseni sp. n. as the sister species of P. fissidentatus, and thus its importance for macro-evolutionary studies. Specifically, the gonochorist P. paulseni sp. n. and the hermaphrodite P. fissidentatus form a species pair that is the sister group to all other described Pristionchus species. P. paulseni sp. n. has two distinct mouth forms, supporting the notion that the mouth dimorphism is ancestral in the genus Pristionchus.

Rotylenchus rhomboides n. sp. is characterized by the presence of a rhomboid-like widening of the mid-ridge of lateral field at the level of vulva, a feature previously unknown within the genus. The population of the new species, composed only by females, has a rounded labial region with 4 to 5 annuli, robust stylet (31-37 mu m long), short dorsal esophageal gland (9-19 mu m) overlap of the intestine, vulva located slightly posterior to mid-body, and hemispherical or rounded tail shape with large phasmids located 3 to 5 annuli anterior to the level of anus. The hierarchical cluster analysis based on morphological features indicated that the new species closely resembles R. corsicus, R. gracilidens, and R. rugatocuticulatus. The DNA analyses of the D2-D3 of 28S rDNA, ITS rDNA, and COI mtDNA sequences of Rotylenchus rhomboides n. sp. show a close relationship with R. buxophilus, R. goodeyi, R. laurentinus, R. pumilus, and R. incultus, all of which can also be differentiated from the new species by morphological features. The combination of morphological, morphometric, and molecular characteristics confirmed the new species and the first report of R. buxophilus on yam (Dioscorea tokoro) in Belgium.

Bursaphelenchus carpini n. sp. and B. cryphali okhotskensis n. subsp. were isolated from Cryphalus carpini emerged from a dead log of a Carpinus sp. collected in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, and from C. piceae emerged from a dead log of Abies sachalinensis collected in Hokkaido, Japan, respectively. Meanwhile, B. laciniatae n. sp. was isolated from the bark of dead Ulmus laciniata, which harboured Scolytus esuriens galleries, collected in Hokkaido, Japan. These three species phylogenetically belong to the eggersi/eremus-group clade and share common typological characters such as a relatively slender body, three-lined lateral field, male spicule with a well-developed condylus, short and wide blade (calomus-lamina complex) and lack of clear cucullus. These three species and subspecies can be distinguished from one another and their close relatives by the condylus shape, female tail shape and phylogenetic and biological characters.

The new species is characterised by a body length of 1040 (920-1124) mu m (females) and 985 (990-1043) mu m (males), lip region continuous, 7.2 (7.0-8.0) mu m broad, 3.3 (3.0-4.0) mu m high, stylet length 8.4 (7.0-9.0) mu m or ca 1.0-1.3 times the lip region diam., lateral fields with five or six incisures, the outer incisures crenate and inner incisures weakly crenate, and excretory pore situated 156 (141-170) mu m from the anterior end. The basal pharyngeal bulb has a short posterior extension projecting dorsally into the intestine. Post-uterine sac absent. Functional males common in the population, spicules 29 (28-30) mu m long. Tail cylindrical with broadly rounded terminus in the female and conical, arcuate, completely enveloped by a well-developed bursa in the male. The new species is compared with two known species of the genus, B. bisulcus and B. pissodi. Molecular phylogenetic studies of the new species using partial sequences of small subunit (SSU) rDNA revealed that it forms a clade with several nematode species belonging to genera in the Sphaerularioidea, namely: Sphaerularia, Paurodontella, Nothotylenchus, and Deladenus.

The former species belongs to the subgenus Kaplinilis Mendes 1990. Among the species described in this subgenus only the males of A. tyrnyauzi sp. n. and A. bifarius (Wygodzinsky 1970), the latter species from western Mongolia and Tuva, show numerous, short, pigmented, appressed setulae on the underside of maxillary palpomeres 5-7 and labial palpomere 3. Allopsontus tyrnyauzi sp. n. differs from A. bifarius by the relatively shorter contact line of the eyes, the more strongly broadened paired ocelli, the right apical angle of the urosternites, the more narrower sensory fields on the fore femora of the male, and the fewer paramere segments. Allopsontus zinchenkoi sp. n. belongs to the subgenus Anisopsontus Mendes 1990 and differs from the other consubgeners by the colour of the compound eyes, the width to length ratio of paired ocelli, the longer abdominal stylus, the larger sensory field on the fore femur of the male, and the relatively short ovipositor.

The new species belongs to morphospecies group 6 of the polytomous key prepared by Loof and Luc, 1990. Xiphinema barooghii n. sp. is characterized by having two almost equally developed female reproductive branches with spines in the tubular portion of the uterus, a body length of 3.67-4.25 mm, a flat lip region, rounded cephalic region, separated from body contour by a shallow depression, a spear 215-225 mu M long, mid-body diameter of 60-79 mu m, vulva (46-48%), a short tail (30-38 mu m, c=103-133, c' =0.7-0.9), conoid, dorsally convex, ventrally directed with a small terminal peg and a distinct terminal blind canal, the presence of four juvenile stages and the absence of males. The polytomous identification codes of the new species are: A4, B3, C5a, D6, E5, F4, G3, H2, 13, J4, K2, L1. In addition to morphological and morphometric data, molecular analyses of the D2-D3 expansion regions of the 28S rDNA gene placed the new species as a sister species of X herakliense (Group 5) with 65% Bayesian posterior probability and further separated this species from the other members in group 6.

Species were delimited using morphology and 396 DNA barcode sequences. Intraspecific and interspecific genetic distances, along with neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, were used to infer putative species limits and monophyly. Additionally, a Poisson-tree-processes model was used to infer putative species boundaries based on the best-scoring maximum likelihood tree. Fifteen species are recognized, two of which are included in a new genus, Phantos Dias gen. nov., erected to include Phantos callidryas comb. nov. and Phantos opalina stat. rev., comb. nov.Zaretis strigosus is formally recognized as a valid species, and four new species, namely Zaretis hurin Dias sp. nov., Zaretis elianahenrichae Dias sp. nov., Zaretis mirandaenrichae Dias sp. nov. and Zaretis crawfordhilli Dias sp. nov., are described.

These species were analysed phylogenetically using 25 morphology-based characters and molecular alignments (COI, 16S, 18S and 28S; 2096 base pairs), with the genus found to be monophyletic based on molecular, morphological and combined analyses. An analysis of host plant associations demonstrated no pattern of co-divergence and limited phylogenetic conservatism, aside from two subclades with respective Calytrix and Myrtaceae preferences. The biogeographic analysis revealed a south-western (South-west Interzone, Western Desert) area relationship, which is in distinction to the orthotyline genus Naranjakotta. The taxonomic component includes an identification key to species and diagnostic characters are illustrated, with detailed documentation of the male genitalia, and the genus uniquely possesses tile-like texture on the apex of the apophysis of the left paramere, and a single endosomal spicule.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			A new genus with two new capitate species of dimorphic soft corals (Octocorallia : Alcyoniidae) from north-western Australia	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						Alcyonacea; COI; Indian Ocean; Kimberley; molecular phylogeny; mtMutS; ND2; Pilbara; 28S	ANTHOZOA; CNIDARIA; FAMILY	Soft coral diversity in tropical northern Australia remains relatively understudied compared with other parts of the world. As a result of ongoing biodiversity surveys, we describe here a new genus of Octocorallia, Anastromvos, gen. nov., and two new species, A. aldersladei, sp. nov. and A. catherinae, sp. nov., collected from waters off the Pilbara, Kimberley and Darwin. To test the validity of the new genus, we used traditional morphological approaches combined with a molecular phylogeny using three mitochondrial genes (COI, mtMutS, ND2) and nuclear 28S. The markers did not amplify for the colony of A. catherinae, sp. nov., which was described on the basis of morphology only. The new genus, belonging to the family Alcyoniidae, is dimorphic, possessing autozooids and siphonozooids, and is characterised by its unique capitate growth form, stone-like colony consistency, heavy autozooid polyp armature and the possession of clubs, tuberculated spindles and/or oval-shaped sclerites and crosses. The molecular phylogeny shows the new genus as the sister group to Sarcophyton + Lobophytum, and forms a unique clade among other alcyoniid clades. The Sarcophyton-Lobophytum group of taxa can be ecologically dominant in shallow-water coral reef communities but there is still much taxonomic refinement needed for these and related genera.

We provide a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the family including representatives of all genera but the monotypic Tucanogovea Karaman, 2013, and new information on the type species described by Jochen Martens in 1969 that were unavailable for molecular study until now: Brasiliogovea microphaga, Metagovea oviformis and '? Gen. enigmaticus'. Additionally, we revisit the somatic and male genitalic morphology of representatives of all genera by means of scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, and describe the new genera Leggogovia Benavides & Giribet, gen. nov., Microgovia Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, gen. nov., Waiwaigovia Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, gen. nov. and 13 new species: Brasiliogovea aphantostylus Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Brasiliogovea microstylus Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Brasiliogovea yacambuensis Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Metagovea matapi Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Metagovea planada Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Microgovia chenepau Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Neogovea branstetteri Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Neogovea enigmatica Martens, sp. nov., Neogovea matawai Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov., Parogovia montealensis Benavides & Giribet, sp. nov., Parogovia prietoi Benavides & Giribet, sp. nov., Parogovia putnami Benavides & Giribet, sp. nov. and Waiwaigovia schultzi Benavides, Hormiga & Giribet, sp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum likelihood, parsimony and Bayesian inference support the monophyly of Neogoveidae and a sister group relationship of Neogoveidae + Ogoveidae with Troglosironidae (a clade named Sternophthalmi). Relationships among neogoveid genera are largely congruent between methods as follows: ((Leggogovia gen. nov., Metasiro), (Parogovia, ((Canga, Microgovia gen. nov.), ((Brasiliogovea, Neogovea), (Huitaca, (Waiwaigovia gen. nov., Metagovea)))))). In light of our results, the following taxonomic changes are proposed: Metagovea oviformis Martens, 1969 is transferred to Microgovia, gen. nov.; Parogovia pabsgarnoni Legg, 1990 is transferred to Leggogovia, gen. nov.; '? Gen. enigmaticus Martens, 1969' is an invalid name according to the ICZN; the corresponding taxon is redescribed and formally named as Neogovea enigmatica Martens, sp. nov.

J	Huber, BA; Caspar, KR; Eberle, J				Huber, Bernhard A.; Caspar, Kai R.; Eberle, Jonas			New species reveal unexpected interspecific microhabitat diversity in the genus Uthina Simon, 1893 (Araneae : Pholcidae)	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						cave-dwelling; leaf-dwelling; Southeast Asia; taxonomy	SPIDERS ARANEAE; EVOLUTION	Representatives of the Southeast Asian pholcid spider genus Uthina Simon, 1893 have been thought to be very homogeneous in their ecology and morphology. The 14 previously known species all inhabit near-ground microhabitats and cave entrances, and range from pale to dark brown in colour. Even their genitalia are partly very similar, with some species pairs being barely distinguishable based on morphological characters. Here we describe three new species from Bali, Java and Sulawesi that represent three further microhabitats and demonstrate considerable ecological and morphological diversity within the genus: U. maya, sp. nov. from Bali is a large dark species on tree trunks; U. hylobatea, sp. nov. from Bali and eastern Java is a pale leaf-dwelling species that exhibits colour dimorphism; and U. mimpi, sp. nov. is a pale troglomorphic species collected in the aphotic zones of two South Sulawesi caves. In addition, we present new data for five previously described species, including ultrastructure, natural history, new records, taxonomic notes and a description of the previously unknown female of Uthina khaosokensis Yao, Li & Jager, 2014. Molecular data suggest that all previously described species are very closely related to each other (constituting the monophyletic luzonica-group), and that the three new species represent separate clades within the genus. However, the basal trichotomy could not be resolved: U. maya + (U. hylobatea + U. mimpi) + luzonica-group.

In the western Indian Ocean, Parasesarma is represented by five species only, although some genetic evidence suggests that P. guttatum could be a species complex comprising two cryptic species. Accordingly, P. guttatum is here split into two pseudocryptic species, and a new species, Parasesarma capensis, sp. nov., is described. P. capensis, sp. nov. fills the same ecological niche as P. guttatum south of the Mozambique Channel. While variation in mitochondrial DNA and morphological differences clearly distinguish the two species, there is no nuclear genetic variation. This may reflect a short history of reproductive isolation. The distinguishing morphological characters of the new species are the 13-15 rounded tubercles on the movable finger, the upper surface of the palm with three transverse crests (one regularly tuberculate and two pectinated), and the shape of the first gonopod. Phylogenetic inference analyses show a sister-species relationship between P. guttatum and P. capensis, sp. nov., and strongly suggest that at least two East African Parasesarma species need a taxonomic revision. The description of this new sesarmid species from the south-eastern African coast sheds new light on the overall biogeographic patterns and general biodiversity of this taxon within the western Indian Ocean.

A new species of Tithaeidae (Arachnida: Opiliones: Laniatores) from Mindanao reveals contemporaneous colonisation of the Philippines by Sunda Shelf opiliofauna	INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						comparative biogeography; Cyphophthalmi; Epedanoidea; Grassatores; Southeast Asia	FAMILY TROGLOSIRONIDAE OPILIONES; MITE HARVESTMEN OPILIONES; BIOGEOGRAPHIC HISTORY; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; MOLECULAR MARKERS; CYPHOPHTHALMI; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMATICS; ORIGIN	The Philippine archipelago harbours a remarkable diversity of harvestmen, with respect to both taxonomy and complexity of biogeographic origins. Among the armoured harvestmen (suborder Laniatores), six families of distantly related groups occur in this archipelago. Here, we describe a new species of the family Tithaeidae, Tithaeus odysseus sp. nov., discovered during a collecting campaign on the island of Mindanao. The description of this species expands the known distribution of the family and demonstrates another exception to the zoogeographic boundary known as Huxley's Line which putatively separates the biota of the Philippines (excluding the Palawan island group) from the Sunda Shelf biota. Given the coincident distributions of Tithaeidae and the mite harvestman family Stylocellidae (Cyphophthalmi), a group renowned for its poor dispersal ability, we inferred phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of the Philippines lineages of both families by using a comprehensive molecular dating analysis of all Opiliones. The internal phylogeny of Tithaeidae mirrored the biogeography of Philippine Stylocellidae, showing a close affinity between the Philippine and Bornean species. Molecular dating showed contemporaneous colonisation of Mindanao by both families in the Cretaceous. We infer these patterns to reflect faunal connections between the southern Philippines and Borneo via the Zamboanga Peninsula. To render the genus Tithaeus monophyletic, we synonymise Metatithaeus with Tithaeus (new synonymy).

SP; INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK	Dokdo Island has a unique biodiversity that has been preserved as a natural monument. Although the biodiversity of Dokdo has been investigated, little information is available regarding the nematodes. The diversity of plant-parasitic nematodes was investigated using both ITS and D2-D3 sequences. Nematodes extracted from 59 rhizosphere soil samples were morphologically identified as belonging to eight genera: Geocenamus, Helicotylenchus, Rotylenchulus, Heterodera, Paratylenchus, Pratylenchus, Pratylenchoides and Xiphinema. Further, nucleotide sequences were determined from 85 individuals of different genera for species diagnosis. We identified 13 species, including three species of the genus Pratylenchus (P. crenatus, P. kumamotoensis and P. neglectus), Helicotylenchus sp. 1, Rotylenchulus sp. 1, Paratylenchus nanus, Heterodera trifolii, Heterodera spp., Pratylenchoides ritteri, Geocenamus sp. 1, Geocenamus sp. 2, Xiphinema brevicollum and Xiphinema sp. 1. The dominant plant-parasitic nematode on Dokdo was P. crenatus, which was found in 25.4% of the samples. Our study provides important information about the biodiversity of plant-parasitic nematodes on Dokdo Island.

All propagative stages of the nematode were found in larval galleries of the large elm bark beetle, Scolytus scolytus, and in overlapping gallery systems of this species and the small European elm bark beetle, S. multistriatus. Dauer juveniles of the new nematode are transmitted to new breeding trees under elytra of adult S. scolytus. Bursaphelenchus michalskii sp. n. is characterised by the female body length of 953 (838-1108) mu m and male body length of 893 (811-971) mu m, very slender body (a = 53.9 (46.1-58.5) and 60.9 (52.2-72.0) in female and male, respectively), lateral fields with three incisures (two bands), excretory pore usually located anterior to the median bulb, lack of vulval flap, long post-uterine sac, relatively small spicules 12.3 (10.8-13.3) mu m long with no cucullus and with distinct, somewhat thorn-like, dorsally bent or reflexed condylus and a conical or digitate rostrum, and the arrangement of the seven male caudal papillae (i.e., a single precloacal ventromedian papilla (P1), one pair of adcloacal ventrosublateral papillae (P2) at or just anterior to cloacal slit, one ventrosublateral, postcloacal pair (P3) located at ca 60% of the tail length, posterior to cloacal slit, and one pair (P4) of ventrosublateral papillae located near the base of the bursa). The newly described species shares most of the key morphological characters with members of the eremus-group (sensu Braasch et al., 2009). However, B. michalskii sp. n. is unique amongst Bursaphelenchus species by a combination of female tail and spicule shape, excretory pore position, and other morphometric characters. These findings were confirmed by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 18S and 28S rDNA regions and by the unique molecular profile of the ITS region (ITS-RFLP).

This new species is characterised by its body length, 'double' cuticle bearing numerous interannular punctations, lateral fields with two longitudinal incisures, lips triangular bearing triangular tines with variation in their morphology, labial probolae bifurcated with prongs bearing triangular tines, pharyngeal corpus 2.8-3.8 times the isthmus length, spermatheca 0.8-1.8 times the body diam., post-vulval sac 1.3-2.2 times the body diam., vagina bent to the left side, vulva located left subventral and very reduced, female tail conoid-elongate, male tail conoid, spicules 24-29 mu m and gubernaculum 13-17 mu m in length. Molecular characterisation of 18S and 28S rRNA shows the relationship of this species with other species of Acrobeles that also present a 'double' cuticle, as well as with other cephalobids (e.g., Cervidellus alutus) with the same characteristic in terms of its cuticle.

The new species is morphologically most closely related to E. minuta and E. veniliae. The new species can easily be distinguished from its congeners by the combination of the following features: i) the shape of the rostrum, ii) having 2 ornamented setae instead of 1 on the syncoxa of the maxilliped, and iii) pattern difference in the P1-P4 setal formula in both male and female. The phylogenetic position of the new species in the genus has also been briefly discussed.

Two species of Aphelinus Dalman, 1820 (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), A. humilis Mercet and A. thomsoni Graham, are recorded for the first time from Georgia and the Caucasus and two species (A. lagodekhiensis sp. nov. and A. sugonjaevi sp. nov.) are described as new to science. To facilitate species identification we have developed a key to the females of all 24 species of Aphelinus currently known from the Middle East and the Caucasus. Both species richness and abundance of Aphelinus increased with increasing elevation, although no statistically significant relationship was found. Maximum diversity and abundance were observed in July, and this was more pronounced at higher elevations.

Systematic revision of Microhyla (Microhylidae) frogs of South Asia: a molecular, morphological, and acoustic assessment	VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Amphibians; bioacoustics; cryptic species; diagnostic characters; integrative taxonomy; Microhylidae; molecular phylogeny; morphology; species groups; new species	1838 ANURA MICROHYLIDAE; NARROW-MOUTH FROGS; FAMILY MICROHYLIDAE; NICOBAR ISLANDS; SRI-LANKA; AMPHIBIA; GENUS; BIODIVERSITY; ANDAMAN; ORNATA	This study presents a systematic revision of South Asian members of the taxonomically challenging genus Microhyla Tschudi, 1838. Species relationships and diagnostic characters are determined by integrating molecular, morphological, and acoustic approaches, through which we also recognize six groups of closely related species. In addition, a new species from the southern Western Ghats of India is formally described as Microhyla darreli sp. nov. Species accounts of all the 16 recognized members from South Asia include current taxonomic status, metric and meristic characters, divergence in mitochondrial DNA, phylogenetic relationships, acoustic characters, revised geographical distributions, and natural history notes. Molecular and morphological relationships of three poorly known members - M. chakrapanii, M. karunaratnei, and M. zeylanica - are clarified for the first time since their original descriptions. The presence of M berdmorei and another potential new species close to M. heymonsi in India is genetically confirmed, and several misidentifications are corrected. For comparative purposes, molecular, morphological, and acoustic relationships are also discussed for eight closely related East and Southeast Asian species. Consequently, insights from this study will facilitate a much-needed comprehensive revision of the Pan-Asian frog genus Microhyla.	[Garg, Sonali; Suyesh, Robin; Alhadi, Farits; Biju, S.

A new species of the blind goby Caecogobius (Gobioidei, Gobiidae, Gobionellinae) from a cave system on Mindanao Island, the Philippines	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Gobiidae; Caecogobius; New species; Cave systems; Philippines	TELEOSTEI; SULAWESI; FISHES	A new species of the eyeless goby genus Caecogobius is described from a cave system on Mindanao Island, the Philippines. Caecogobius personatus sp. nov. is the second cave-obligate fish ever discovered from the Philippine archipelago. The first species, Caecogobius cryptophthalmus Berti and Ercolini 1991 was recorded from Samar Island, an adjacent island north of Mindanao. The new species differs from its only congener, C. cryptophthalmus, in having a finely ridged fleshy area over the orbit and fleshy flap-like sensory papillae on fleshy raised ridges (the sensory papillae in C. cryptophthalmus are all small and evenly sized, not fleshy or flap-like) and having all elements of the second dorsal fin segmented (first element unsegmented in C. cryptophthalmus). The relationship of these two Caecogobius to each other and to other gobionellines is not known.

Although A. pauciporus and Ablabys taenianotus (Cuvier 1829) both share counts of 4 or 5 anal-fin soft rays with a short fin base and 11 or 12 pectoral-fin rays, the former has distinctly lower counts of body scales, including number of lateral-line pores (12 or 13 vs. 20-25 in the latter), strongly notched interspinous dorsal-fin membranes (vs. weakly notched or unnotched), and some differing morphometrics (including head depth, orbit diameter and pelvic-fin length) and coloration. Ablabys gymnothorax is most similar to Ablabys macracanthus (Bleeker 1852) in having more than 7 anal-fin soft rays with a long fin base, but differs from the latter in having a naked thorax (vs. scaled), the last dorsal-fin soft ray with a continuous basal membrane to the dorsal edge of the caudal peduncle and the basal upper margin of the caudal fin (vs. not continuous with caudal fin), higher counts of dorsal- and anal-fin rays, body scales and gill rakers, and in some morphometrics. Tetraroge vestitus De Vis 1884, previously considered as a junior synonym of A. taenianotus, is regarded here as a junior synonym of Centropogon marmoratus Gunther 1862.

(Apogonidae) is described on the basis of 79 specimens collected from the western Pacific Ocean. The new species is most similar to the Indo-West Pacific species Rhabdamia gracilis (Bleeker 1856) in having VI-I, 9 dorsal-fin rays, II, 12 anal-fin rays and 13 pectoral-fin rays, and lacking blackish blotches on the opercle and anterior portion of the body. However, the former can be distinguished from R. gracilis by having 26-31 (modally 28-29) developed gill rakers, 27-31 (modally 28) total gill rakers (including rudiments), body depth at second dorsal-fin origin 25.5-33.1% of SL (mean 30.2%) and a subdermal black blotch or spot on the lower caudal peduncle. Three nominal species, Apogonichthys nudus Regan 1905, Apogonichthys mentalis Evermann and Seale 1907 and Rhabdamia clupeiformis Weber 1909, are regarded as junior synonyms of R. gracilis.

It is characterised by its 2.90-4.45 mm long body, lip region offset by deep constriction, 31-39 mu m broad and slightly sucker-like with distinctly protruding perioral liplets, odontostyle 34-37 mu m long with aperture occupying 37-42% its length, neck 673-883 mu m long, pharyngeal expansion occupying 48-52% of total neck length, female genital system didelphic-amphidelphic, uterus long and complex, including an intermediate pars musculosa, vulva longitudinal (V = 51-54), caudal region short and rounded (27-39 mu m, c = 93-135, c' = 0.6-0.8), spicules 76-89 mu m long, and 20-25 nearly contiguous ventromedian supplements with an hiatus. Previous information about the species is analysed and discussed in the light of the present redescription. A new name, Labronemella zullinii sp. n., is proposed for the two females from Nepal described by Zullini in 1973. This new characterisation of L. ferox lays the foundations to study the taxonomy of the genus in more detail.

The genus Labrys was recently described characterised by a remarkable lip pattern that differs from all other known Tylenchidae genera. Here we describe a curious new species, Labrys fujianensis sp. n., that morphologically fits the genus Labrys but which is genetically divergent. The phylogeny was inferred based on 18S and 28S rDNA and light and scanning electron microscopy were used to extract detailed morphologies. The phylogenetic position of this species and its phenotypic convergence are discussed. The possibility of a long-branch attraction artefact was inspected both by removal of variable nucleotide sites and monophyletic testing of topologies. The results confirmed the divergent positioning of the presented species and it is demonstrated that the genetic diversity in Tylenchidae may be much higher than expected due to morphological homoplasy.

(Nematoda: Desmodoridae), a cryptic species related to S. parasitifera, from the coast of New Zealand	NEMATOLOGY			English	Article						28S rDNA gene; D2-D3 region; description; morphology; new species; Pauatahanui Inlet; small subunit (SSU) 18S rDNA gene; species complex; Spiriniinae; taxonomy	POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MARINE NEMATODES; SSU RDNA; SEQUENCES; IDENTIFICATION; PHYLOGENIES; SEDIMENTS; TAXONOMY; BLOCKS; 18S	Spirinia parasitifera is a common nematode species recorded from coastal habitats of the White, North and Barents Seas, the Northwest Atlantic, the Maldives and Australia, and exhibits a high degree of variability in some morphological characters. For these reasons it has been suggested that S. parasitifera is a species complex comprised of several distinct but potentially cryptic species. However, no study has yet combined molecular and morphological approaches to verify this assertion. Here, we describe S. antipodea n. sp., a species morphologically very similar to S. parasitifera, from the coast of New Zealand. Spirinia antipodea n. sp. differs from the original description of S. parasitifera as well as subsequent descriptions by other authors in at least one body dimension, but no single trait differs consistently between the New Zealand specimens and all descriptions of S. parasitifera. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the new species is distinct from other species of the genus, including S. parasitifera specimens sampled near the type locality. The S. antipodea n. sp. SSU sequence differed from other Spirinia sequence by 2.1-5.3%, whilst D2-D3 of LSU sequences differed by 12.5-18.9%. The consensus SSU tree also recovered three distinct S. parasitifera clades, which provides support for the existence of a species complex. Because it is not possible to determine whether the variability in morphological characters observed among descriptions of S. parasitifera is intra- or interspecific, and therefore to determine which trait can reliably be used to differentiate between S. antipodea n. sp. and S. parasitifera, the new species is best differentiated from S. parasitifera and other closely related species based on SSU sequences rather than morphological characters.

Morphological, morphometric, molecular and cross-hybridisation studies placed these nematodes into a new species, Steinernema kandii n. sp., within the bicornutum-group. Phylogenetic analyses based on both ITS and D2-D3 regions of 28S rDNA revealed that S. kandii n. sp. is different from all known Steinernema species and sister to S. abbasi (97.3-97.6% ITS nucleotide similarity) and S. bifurcatum (98.3-98.4% D2-D3 similarity). Steinernema kandii n. sp. can be separated from other members of the bicornutum-group by the greater infective juvenile (IJ) max. body diam. of 35 (27-48) mu m (type isolate). It differs from S. abbasi by the greater IJ body length 707 (632-833) mu m (type isolate), EP distance 55 (52-60) mu m (type isolate), spicule length 67 (57-75) mu m (type isolate) and the occurrence of one pair of genital papillae at the cloacal aperture.

Basilaphelenchus brevicaudatus n. sp., the third species of this apparently rare genus, is described and illustrated. It was recovered from wood and bark samples from a dead forest tree in the Golestan province of northern Iran. It is typologically characterised by female body length (448 (365-492) mu m), three lines in the lateral fields, raised cephalic region having a sclerotised vestibule and cephalic framework, stylet thin with delicate conus and thicker shaft, both parts lacking a visible lumen, and with three elongate, backwardly directed knobs, small, spherical to spade-shaped metacorpus with small, posteriorly located valve (at 72 (58-74)% of metacorpus length), simple vulva without flap at 72.5 (69-78)% of body length, post-vulval uterine sac 32.4 (29.0-37.0) mu m long, functional rectum and anus, female tail conical, short (c' = 2.6 (1.9-3.3) in female, and 2.5 (2.3-2.8) in male), dorsally convex and ventrally concave with blunt end or having a small mucron, both forms with a hyaline-like tip. Males common, with well-curved 9.2 (9.0-10.5) mu m long spicules measured along the mid-line, three pairs of small caudal papillae (lacking the single P1 ventral papilla) and no bursa at tail tip, but with hyaline region, similar to females. Basilaphelenchus brevicaudatus n. sp. is compared with the two currently known species of the genus, the type species, B. persicus, and B. grosmannae. Molecular phylogenetic inferences using partial sequences of small and large subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU and LSU) from different isolates of the new species revealed that it belongs to the Tylaphelenchinae clade.

The new species is characterised by body length of 656 (580-786) mu m (females) and 490 (480-500) mu m (males), weakly annulated cuticle, four lines in the lateral field, and an offset lip region. The stylet is 10.5 (10-11) mu m long and has small basal swellings. The excretory pore is located at nerve ring level and the hemizonid was not seen. The post-vulval uterine sac is 40.8 (38-43) mu m long, the spicules are relatively short (18-19 mu m in dorsal limb), and the male tail has the usual three pairs of caudal papillae (2 + 2 + 2). The female tail is subcylindrical with two or three minute processes at the tip. The new species belongs to the Group 3 category of Aphelenchoides species and is close to seven known species of the genus, namely: A. asteromucronatus, A. besseyi, A. fujianensis, A. goodeyi, A. ritzemabosi, A. siddiqii, and A. stellatus, but differs by body size, shape of tail mucron, stylet length, size of spicules, and length of post-vulval uterine sac. Phylogenetic analysis based on small subunit (SSU) and partial large subunit (LSU) sequences of rRNA supported the morphological results.

The morphometric data of the Chinese populations were compared with all previously reported populations. The SEM observations of en face views indicated that H. chitwoodi and H. parasinensis have lip patterns belonging to type 1 and phylogenetically both species clustered with other Hemicriconemoides species that showed the same kind of lip pattern. On the other hand, H. fujianensis showed a lip pattern belonging to type 2 and phylogenetically appears basal to the above-mentioned clade. SEM observation of C. myungsugae showed that the first lip annulus forms a non-projecting uninterrupted disc and the labial annulus is a rectangular shape with slight dorsal and ventral indentations. Phylogenetic relationships among Criconemoides spp. are apparently not well resolved. The present study provides updated morphological descriptions, molecular diagnostics and phylogenetic relationships of H. chitwoodi, H. fujianensis, H. parasinensis, and C. myungsugae, the last species being the first report from China.

The new species was isolated from bat guano collected from a calcareous cave in Japan. The new species is characterised by its three-lined lateral field, secretory-excretory pore at the level of the posterior two-thirds of the metacorpus, a long post-uterine sac, hermaphrodite tail shape elongate conoid with a filiform tip, and an androdioecious reproductive mode. The new species is typologically and biologically close to S. steineri, but is distinguished by its longer post-uterine sac, slightly longer stylet and slightly larger median bulb. The comparisons with other morphologically similar species, i.e., S. chertkovi, S. tenuicaudata and S. steineri, are discussed. A molecular phylogenetic analysis based on two small and large subunit ribosomal RNA genes revealed that the new species is located at the basal position of clade 3 of the Aphelenchoididae, clearly separate from S. demani, its congener with unclear rectum and anus, which is located at the derived position, suggesting that further generic revision is necessary for the genus.

This is the first report of the order Synallactida for Argentina, the fifth for southern hemisphere and the deepest report for the Argentinian holothuroid fauna (almost 3000 m). The species has up to 330 mm length, light brown color and around 19 pairs of dorsal appendages. The ventral side has one ventral ambulacra, with two rows of tube feet. Ossicles are present in dorsal appendages, tube feet, tentacles and body wall near the anus, and are mainly crosses, tables and rods-shaped. The depth at which P. shumel n. sp. has been found is occupied by the North Atlantic Deep Water current. This association with North Atlantic waters could be related with the occurrence of members of Paelopatides in the North Atlantic. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

A case study in Creoxylus and Prexaspes (Insecta: Phasmatodea) from the Brazilian Amazon Basin	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Creoxylus duckei sp. nov.; Neotropics; Phasmids; Phallic complex; Stick insect		The male genitalia have been neglected in Phasmatodea studies over the years. There are few works describing and illustrating this organ and no studies demonstrating its usage. Concerned by this matter, this paper aimed to investigate whether the male genitalia of Phasmatodea is useful for systematics. First, by describing a new species of Creoxylus Audinet-Serville (Creoxylus duckei sp. nov.) and including the description of its male genitalia, along with the differentiation from the male genitalia of the know species Creoxylus spinosus (Fabricius). By comparing these two genitalia, the first case of chirality in Phasmatodea was reported. Secondly, by describing the genitalia of two Prexaspes Stal species (Prexaspes viridipes Stal and another identified to genus level) and making the differentiation between them. Finally, by comparing all four described genitalia. Results showed that the male genitalia are useful to differentiation and identification of species/genera.

Integrative taxonomy: Morphology and ancient DNA barcoding reveals the true identity of Astyanax taeniatus, a tetra collected by Charles Darwin during the Beagle's voyage	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Characidae; COI; Darwin; DNA; Corrego das Aduelas; Taxonomy	CHARACIFORMES; CHARACIDAE	Many of the early descriptions of Characidae species are very short and mainly vague, lacking essential information for a reliable diagnosis and determination of species. That is the case of Astyanax taeniatus. In a break from his journey on board the HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin wandered the interior of Rio de Janeiro State, and collected two small fishes that were briefly described in 1842 by Jenyns as Tetrago-nopterus taeniatus, and later transferred to Astyanax by Eigenmann. Since then, both the identity and the type-locality of the species have remained somewhat elusive, generating taxonomic confusion with other congeneric species and misidentifications. A redescription of A. taeniatus in 2001 perpetuated the problem, since the type-material was not examined and the geographic region covered by that study was relatively limited, maintaining the taxonomic uncertainty to the present day. In this study, in order to retrieve taxonomic data and to warrant an accurate identification for A. taeniatus henceforth, we integrated molecular and morphology data obtained from syntypes and new specimens collected in the type-locality. Additionally, information from Darwin's journal and from a Brazilian project to retrieve Darwin's travels in Brazil ("Caminhos de Darwin"), allowed to accurately locate the A. taeniatus type-locality at Conceicao de Macabti municipality, northern Rio de Janeiro State. The two syntypes of T. taeniatus were examined and a tissue sample was extracted from one of them to compare genetically to other Astyanax species. Then, the Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I (COI) sequence of this syntype was included in a matrix with 30 characid species from Brazilian coastal rivers, including those collected in the Corrego das Aduelas at type-locality. The smallest values of p-distance (0.01) were found between the sequences of the syntype and specimens of Astyanax from Corrego das Aduelas, Rio Macae basin, in "Fazenda Socego". The anatomical and meristic information of the modern specimens collected in the type-locality also agree with data from the syntypes. Integrating morphology and molecular techniques for ancient DNA, we succeeded to definitely solve the taxonomy of A. taeniatus and also identify modern topotypes in Corrego das Aduelas at Conceicao de Macabu (RJ). Based on the syntypes and on a collection of A. taeniatus, including topotypes, the species is herein redescribed and a lectotype is designated. Besides, the accurately delimitation of A. taeniatus allowed us to detect and describe a new species, Astyanax keronolepis n. sp., which has been occasionally misidentified as A. taeniatus.

New species justification was based on external morphology, histology, and molecular sequence data. Leeches are small, up to 12 mm total length. Oral sucker is larger than caudal sucker, with 1 pair of eyes on the oral sucker and 10 ocelli on the caudal sucker. Segmental ocelli occur both dorsally and ventrally on the urosome. Small papillae are present on urosome segments, but pulsatile vesicles are absent. There are 6 pairs of testisacs. The male reproductive system has a muscular organ replacing the typical atrium and a complex system of conducting/vector tissue. Mycetomes are present, and postceca are fused with fenestrae at each ganglion.

Typically, the DNA of each individual sample is separately extracted and undergoes qPCR analysis. However, when performing field surveys and long-term monitoring, a large fraction of the samples is generally expected to be negative, especially in geographical areas still considered free of the pathogen. If pathogen detection within a population - rather than determining its individual prevalence - is the focus, work load and monetary costs can be reduced by pooling samples for DNA extraction. We test and refine a user-friendly technique where skin swabs can be pooled during DNA extraction to detect the amphibian chytrid fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal). We extracted pools with different numbers of samples (from one to four swabs), without increasing reaction volumes, and each pool had one sample inoculated with a predetermined zoospore amount. Pool size did not reduce the ability to detect the two fungi, except if inoculated with extremely low zoospore amounts (one zoospore). We confirm that pooled DNA extraction of cutaneous swabs can substantially reduce processing time and costs without minimizing detection sensitivity. This is of relevance especially for the new emerging pathogen Bsal, for which pooled DNA extraction had so far not been tested and massive monitoring efforts in putatively unaffected regions are underway.

SP MYXOSPOREA; ACTINOSPOREAN STAGES; BRANCHIURA-SOWERBYI; ALTERNATE HOST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL CHANGES; RIBOSOMAL DNA; LAKE BALATON; TRIACTINOMYXON; PARASITE	Three new types of sphaeractinomyxon (Cnidaria, Myxozoa) are described from the coelomic cavity of the marine oligochaete Tubificoides insularis, collected from the Alvor estuary, Algarve, Portugal. Another known type is also registered from this location and host: Sphaeractinomyxon type 10 of Rangel et al. (2016), which was originally described from the marine oligochaete Tubificoides pseudogaster in the Aveiro estuary, Portugal. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the case isolates and all other available SSU rRNA sequences of sphaeractinomyxon clustering within a Glade containing Myxobolus spp. that infect mullets, thus suggesting that this collective group plays a role in the life cycle of mugiliform-infecting myxobolids. Also clustering within this Glade were all types of tetraspora and endocapsa, calling into question the distinctiveness of these collective groups. Acknowledging a previous work showing that the pansporocysts of sphaeractinomyxon produce a variable number of actinospores, we suggest that the tetraspora collective group be deemed invalid and its types transferred to sphaeractinomyxon. In turn, endocapsa requires validation through the description of new types truly differentiating them from sphaeractinomyxon.

Recently, we discovered a flightless dipteran species skating rapidly on the surface of seawater ponds at the Pacific coast of eastern China. Morphological analyses initially suggested an isolated position of the non-biting midge, suggesting the erection of a new genus within Chironomini (Diptera: Chironomidae). However, an analysis of molecular data revealed that the marine species is in fact nested within the species-rich genus Dicrotendipes. The apparent conflict between molecular and morphological data can be easily explained. It is likely that the new species has evolved a series of autapomorphic adaptations. These traits clearly distinguish the taxon from other species of the genus but do not justify the erection of a new supraspecific taxon, which would render Dicrotendipes paraphyletic. The switch to marine environments was likely a trigger for various morphological modifications resulting from increased selective pressure. Molecular data suggest that the potential speciation event occurred around 19-29 Ma, linked with a migration from freshwater to seawater ponds along the Pacific Ocean. Considering the results of our analysis, we place the flightless marine skater in the genus Dicrotendipes. All life stages of Dicrotendipes sinicus Qi & Lin sp. n. are described and illustrated, associated with larvae obtained by rearing or confirmed through association with DNA barcodes. The biology and ecology of the species are outlined based on collection data and in situ observations. Evolutionary patterns linked with repeated invasions of marine habitats are discussed.

Dihoplotermes taurus sp. nov., a new Termitinae termite species, is illustrated and described based on morphological characters from soldiers, workers, and imago. The new species is distinguished from Dihoplotermes inusitatus Araujo by having a spine-like protuberance with blunt apex on the postmentum, the presence of a spine on the gizzard and the absence of dimorphic soldiers. Furthermore, the internal morphological characteristics of a Dihoplotermes worker are described for the first time. Both internal and external morphological characters were used to improve the characterization of the species.
