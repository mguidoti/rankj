(Bivalvia: Mytilidae) endemic in the Kattegat-Skagerrak	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Modiolus cimbricus sp. nov.; endemic; Kattegat; Skagerrak	FUTURE; LARVAE; SEA	Small usually beautifully coloured mussels from the Kattegat were to date identified as Modiolus adriaticus (Lamarck, 1819) since C.G. Johs. Petersen's account of the shell-bearing molluscs was published in 1888. However, these mussels from Danish and Swedish waters represent a very distinct new species which also is endemic. The present paper serves to describe this new species, Modiolus cimbricus sp. nov., which belongs to the genus Modiolus Lamarck, 1799. The genus Gibbomodiola Sacco, 1898, to which Modiolus adriaticus has been moved, is here synonymized with Modiolus Lamarck, 1799.

Sudha			Description of a new species of freshwater crab of the genus Arcithelphusa Pati & Sudha Devi, 2015 (Decapoda: Brachyura: Gecarcinucidae) from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Crustacea; taxonomy; Cylindrotelphusa; Vela; habitat preference	CRUSTACEA; POTAMIDAE; REVISION; ECOLOGY; CHINA; YEO	A new species of the hitherto monotypic gecarcinucid freshwater crab genus, Arcithelphusa Pati & Sudha Devi, 2015, is described from the Western Ghats, in the Wayanad district of Kerala, India. Arcithelphusa tumpikkai sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from the only congener, A. cochleariformis Pati & Sudha Devi, 2015, mainly by its relatively broader carapace, the presence of a short flagellum on the exopod of the third maxilliped, and the relatively less stout male first gonopod, with a sharply bent and relatively long terminal segment. The diagnosis for Arcithelphusa is emended to include the new species, which can be useful in distinguishing it from the closely related genus Cylindrotelphusa Alcock, 1909. The state of Kerala now has 38 species of gecarcinucid crabs, including the present new species.	[Pati, S.

(Annelida: Eunicida: Eunicidae), is described from the Marine Annelids Hatchery of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, Aquaculture Department (SEAFDECAQD), Iloilo Province, Philippines. It represents the first record of this group in the Philippines. The new species is most similar morphologically toM. hongkongensa Wang, Zhang & Qiu. 2018, but can be distinguished from it by having fewer branchial filaments. a pair of faint eyes (absent in M. hongkongensa), and in slight differences in jaw morphology and chaetation. The embryos of the new species develop inside a jelly cocoon attached to the entrance of the adult burrow; this is the first time that egg-containing cocoons have been found in any species of the sanguinea-group. Phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) revealed that Marphysa iloiloensis n. sp. is genetically distinct from all other analysed Marphysa species and forms a sister group to M. hongkongensa. A revised identification key to members of the sanguinea-group in Southeast Asia is provided.

The southernmost Japanese species was separated from its geographically (and yew likely phylogenetically) closest relatives that live on Kynshu by over a thousand kilometers of the Pacific Ocean. Paraneseuthia zanetae sp. n., found on Okinawa Jima, the largest Ryukyuan island, is described, filling this wide distributional gap. The new species is yet another member of the informal P. paradoxa group, which comprises all Japanese members of this genus that share similar male protibial modifications and a complicated structure of the aedeagus; also two Russian Far Eastern species show close morphological affinities to those inhabiting the Japanese Archipelago.

As a result, a new species, Pugettia ferox, which had long been believed to be a local variant of P. quadridens sensu lato in the northeast Japan, is described. Despite moderate sexual dimorphism and considerable variability related to their ontogeny, the three species can be distinguished from each other by the combination of various morphological characters including the structure of the orbital region and male first gonopods. The patterns of ontogenetic morphological and morphometric changes in the chelipeds, gonopods, and pleons are also differentiated among the three species. The updated distribution ranges of three species greatly overlap in the northeast Asian waters, although P. quadridens sensu stricto is distributed more southward than P. ferox n. sp.. Distinguishing characters between P. quadridens s.s. and P. pellucens Rathbun, 1932, and between P. intermedia and P. vulgaris Ohtsuchi, Kawamura & Takeda, 2014, are revised.

All belong to a group of yellow species that occur exclusively in mangroves. Three species were previously known: Elaphropeza calcarifera Bezzi, 1912 and E. xanthocephala Bezzi, 1912, both from Taiwan, and E. riatanae Shamshev & Grootaert, 2007 from Singapore. Four species are new to science: Elaphropeza furcatella sp. nov., E. guenardi sp. nov., E. hongkongensis sp. nov. and E. hongshulin sp. nov. All seven species are described or an extended diagnosis is provided. All species arc figured and NGS barcodes arc made available. A key is given for the Hong Kong species and their siblings from Singapore and Taiwan. Remarkable is that five of the seven species are more or less closely related to species occurring in Singapore. Genetic distances and morphologic differences are congruent. The species turnover between the northern part and the southern part of the South China Sea is high, with only one of the seven species present in both regions.

Twelve specimens including both sexes of the new species, described herein as Synagoga arabesque sp. nov., were collected from colonies of the antipatharian Myriopathes cf. japonica Brook, 1889. Three previously described species of Synagoga, morphologically the least specialized ascothoracidan genus, have been found as ectoparasites of antipatharians and an alcyonarian, whereas all other records of this genus have been based on specimens collected from the marine plankton. This is the second study of a new form of Synagoga to be based on more than a few mature specimens of a single sex or on a single juvenile. Furthermore, it is the second in which SEM has been used to document the fine-scale external morphology. The position of terminal pores in the anterior pairs of the lattice organs is different in Synagoga arabesque sp. nov. than those in S. grygieri Kolbasov & Newman, 2018 and S. millipalus Grygier & Ohtsuka, 1995. Species of Synagoga are small, host-specific predators or ectoparasites of antipatharians. This genus exhibits a major Tethyan reliction pattern.

Clathria (Axosuberites) Topsent, 1893 is characterized by having digitate, whip-like, arborescent and flabellate growth forms, lacking echinating spicules, well differentiated axial and extra-axial skeleton, styles and/or subtylostyles as principal spicules, and microscleres palmate isochelae and toxas. The subgenus contains 19 valid species, with worldwide distribution predominantly in shallow waters. Six species occur in the Atlantic Ocean and two of them are recorded from the Western Atlantic in South America: Clathria (Axosuberites) riosae Van Soest, 2017, and Clathria (Axosuberites) marplatensis (Cuartas, 1992). Specimens analyzed in this study were collected in 2015 at Mamanguape estuary, Paraiba State, and in 2017 at Tutoia beach, Maranhao State. Here we described two new species of Clathria (Axosuberites) for the first time in Brazilian waters: Clathria (Axosuberites) aurantia n. sp. and Clathria (Axosuberites) hillenburgi n. sp.

Based on examination of external morphology, color pattern, and 681 base pairs of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene, we demonstrate the presence of four morphologically distinct lineages of Lipinia in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia, showing a sequence divergence ranging 15.5%-20.4%. All discovered lineages are discretely diagnosable from one another by a combination of scalation traits and color patterns. A review of the published distribution data and a re-examination of available type material revealed the following results: (1) distribution of L. vittigera (Boulenger, 1894) sensu stricto is restricted to Sundaland and the Thai-Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra; (2) L. microcercus (Boettger, 1901) stat. nov. is elevated to full species rank; the species has a wide distribution from central and southern Vietnam across Cambodia to eastern Thailand; we regard Lygosoma vittigerum kronfanum Smith, 1922 and Leiolopisma pranensis Cochran, 1930 as its junior synonyms; (3) Lipinia trivittata sp. nov. occurs in hilly areas of southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and eastern Thailand; and (4) Lipinia vassilievi sp. nov. is currently known only from a narrow area along the Vietnamese-Cambodian border in the foothills of the central Annamite Mountain Range. We further provide an identification key for Lipinia occurring in mainland Southeast Asia.

We present a new Lynceus (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Laevicaudata) species, Lynceus amplopedia sp. nov., from Yunnan, China, which shows significant left-right differences in some non-clasper thoracopods. It can be distinguished from all congeners by asymmetrically modified thoracopods III-VI. In the 'explanate modified' side (usually the left side, occasionally the right) the following modifications are present: endites 4,5, and endopod enlarged (explanate) (thoracopods III and IV); exopod with 14-15 digitiform processes dorsomedially (thoracopods V and VI); and broad muscular basis (thoracopods III-V). The following modifications are seen in the thoracopods of the opposing 'spinose modified' side (usually the right side, occasionally the left): endite 4 with robust, specialized spines medially (thoracopods V and VI); endite 3 elongate protruding (thoracopod VI), and broad muscular basis (thoracopod V). Other unique characters of the new species include: male and female rostrum sinuate, compound eyes protruding, male claspers with endopod constricted, and endite 3 with two scale patches. We suggest the modified thoracopods may be involved in mating and/or respiration. The diversity of Chinese Lynceus is also discussed.

Revision of Hyalopale (Chrysopetalidae; Phyllodocida; Annelida): an amphi-Atlantic Hyalopale bispinosa species complex and five new species from reefs of the Caribbean Sea and Indo-Pacific Oceans	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Morphology; taxonomy; DNA; paedomorphism; cryptic species; biogeography; phylogeny	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; LIZARD ISLAND; POLYCHAETA; SYLLIDAE; PHYLOGENY; EUNICIDAE; TAXONOMY; PALOLA; CLADES	The formerly monotypic taxon, Hyalopale bispinosa Perkins 1985 (Cluysopetalinac), is comprised of a cryptic species complex from predominantly tropical embayments and island reefs of the Western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. Hyalopale species are of meiofaunal size (length: 1-2.8mm), but considered non-interstitial, with the majority of species inhabiting a singular habitat of shallow littoral zones among algae and epifauna overlying sediments in rubble. Hyalopale adults exhibit notochaetal fans characterized by the presence of lateral and midlinc notochaetal spines. Species of Hyalopale can be distinguished by the shape of glass-like notochaetal paleae and the number of densely stacked ribs. Hyalopale bispinosa forms a western and eastern Atlantic species complex, comprising the type species, Hyalopale bispinosa s.s., a comparatively larger form with the highest number of notochaetal paleael ribs from Florida, and Hyalopale cf. bispinosa, from the western and eastern Mediterranean, a smaller form with a similar notochaetal morphology to the latter. Unfortunately, no molecular sequence data is available for Hyalopale bispinosa s.s. Five new species are described, with molecular sequence data provided for three: Hyalopale leslieae sp. nov., a small form with a comparatively low number of paleal ribs, found from the Florida Keys to Belize, Caribbean Sea, H. zerofskii sp. nov. from southern California and Mexico, eastern Pacific and HI sapphiriglancyorum sp. nov., a distinctive species with the lowest number of paleael ribs, from Raja Ampat, Indonesia and the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, western Pacific. Two other species are described from morphology alone: H. angeliensis sp. nov. from Dampier, Western Australia and Seychelle Islands, eastern Indian Ocean and H. furfuricula sp. nov. from the Red Sea and Mozambique, western Indian Ocean, possessing a unique paleal brow shape. While well supported as a Glade, support for relationships within Hyalopale is low. Hyalopale cf. bispinosa (Mediterranean) was recovered as sister group to the remaining Hyalopale, with H. leslieae sp. nov. as sister to the Hyalopale Pacific clade, comprising H. zerofskii sp. nov. (eastern Pacific) and H. sapphiriglancyorum sp. nov. (western Pacific). Within Chiysopetalinae, Hyalopale and Paleanotus formed a Glade that was the sister group to the other paleate chrysopetalids under maximum likelihood, though Paleanotus grouped with the other paleate forms under maximum parsimony. The adult morphology of Hyalopale species is compared with that exhibited in the larvae of Paleanotus species; based on these results, including possession of a shared notochaetal character, Hyalopale is considered to contain paedomorphic taxa.

Two new species of Geodiidae (Porifera, Demospongiae, Astrophorina) from the Emperor Seamounts, North Pacific Ocean	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Porifera; Geodiidae; Geodia; Erylus; Emperor Seamounts; new species; North Pacific Ocean	ALEUTIAN ISLANDS; ALASKA	Two new species of Geodiidae from the Emperor Seamounts, North Pacific Ocean are described and compared to congeners. Erylus imperator n. sp. differs from all other species of Erylus from the region in having large oxyasters, present in only one other species from which it differs in several other characters. Furthermore these oxyasters most often display the tendency to reduce the number of rays to a degree that they appear as triods, microxeas or even microtylostyles, depending on the number of retained rays. The second new species, Geodia arma n. sp. is a Geodia without triaenes, a group formerly described under the genus Geodinella. We compared G. arma n. sp. with all congeners lacking triaenes and determined that it is the only known species with a cortex of up to 6 mm in thickness and also the only species with oxeas up to 6 mm in length Which range from thin and sinuous to thick and straight. To our knowledge these are the first descriptions of sponge species from the Emperor Seamount region.

New records of Swiftia (Cnidaria, Anthozoa, Octocorallia) from off the Pacific Costa Rican margin, including a new species from methane seeps	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Carbonate mounds; gorgonian; methane seeps; Plexauridae; Swiftia; taxonomy	PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GENUS	Exploration of the deep sea off the Pacific margin of Costa Rica has resulted in the discovery of a number of new species and reports for the region. Here, we report on the occurrence of the octocoral genus Swiftia, and describe a new species collected by the Alvin submersible off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The new species has been observed at around 1000 m depth, growing on authigenic carbonates near methane seeps. Swiftia sahlingi sp. nov. is characterised by having bright red colonies that are with limited branching, with slightly raised polyp-mounds, thin coenenchyme mainly composed of long warty spindles, and conspicuous plates. A molecular phylogenetic analysis supports the differences between this new taxon and the closest Swiftia species. The new species represents the first record of the genus from Costa Rica and in fact for the Eastern Tropical Pacific.

Further 4 new species of Acrometopini are described from the area (Horatosphaga laticerca n. sp., Horatosphaga scalata n. sp., Peronura wottae n. sp., and Tenerasphaga mpwapwae n. sp.). 78 Acridoidea species were recorded. Miombo woodlands are vanishing rapidly these days so that faunal information will become an important tool to measure habitat quality of a certain forested area and for restauration measures. The species Peronura wottae n. sp. and Kefalia grafika n. sp. must be considered as Critically Endangered since only known from Wotta Forest Reserve on the Mpwapwa plateau. This forest reserve is heavily degraded by illegal cutting and lifestock grazing and will disappear in the near future if no immediate measures are taken by responsible authorities.

The new species was characterized by combination of the following features: its 590-675 mu m long body, finely annulated cuticle in light microscopy (LM), lateral field with two smooth incisures, cephalic region dorso-ventrally flattened with protuberant, elongate and laterally extended labial plate, appearing a V-shaped piece in lateral view, amphidial openings as longitudinal slits confined to labial plate in scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, stylet 7.5-9.0 mu m long, elongated fusiform median bulb with faint valvular apparatus, excretory pore wide with moderately sclerotized duct and elongate filiform tail with finely rounded tip. Compared to four currently known species under the genus, the new species has a remarkably larger and more prominent labial plate as revealed by SEM and trapezoid cephalic region under LM. The molecular phylogenetic analyses of the new species using partial SSU rDNA revealed it has close affinity with three species of Labrys (L. chinensis, L. fuzhouensis and L. filiformis) in Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods and occupied a placement inside their Glade. L. fujianensis, the other species of the genus, occupied a distant placement to the aforementioned Glade. This is the second species of Labrys being originally described from Iran, representing the third species of Labrys occurring in the country.

A phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequence data shows that Zischkaia is monophyletic and consists of two morphologically diagnosable clades. Morphological characters and DNA 'barcodes' support the recognition of twelve species in the genus, a significant increase even for the relatively poorly studied subtribe Euptychiina. Consequently, nine new species are described and named herein, including Z. arctoa Nakahara, sp. nov., Z. chullachaki Nakahara & Zacca, sp. nov., Z. baku Zacca, Dolibaina & Dias, sp. nov., Z. arenisca Nakahara, Willmott & Hall, sp. nov., Z. argyrosflecha Nakahara, L.

More than 4800 specimens and relevant type material were studied; 234 sampled specimens produced COI sequences. The study recognises 41 species, 18 of which are described as new to science, mainly from Fennoscandian material: Ophion angularis Johansson & Cederberg sp. nov., Ophion arenarius Johansson sp. nov., Ophion autumnalis Johansson sp. nov., Ophion borealis Johansson sp. nov., Ophion broadi Johansson sp. nov., Ophion brocki Johansson sp. nov., Ophion confusus Johansson sp. nov., Ophion ellenae Johansson sp. nov., Ophion inclinans Johansson sp. nov., Ophion kallanderi Johansson sp. nov., Ophion matti Johansson sp. nov., Ophion norei Johansson sp. nov., Ophion paraparvulus Johansson sp. nov., Ophion paukkuneni Johansson sp. nov., Ophion splendens Johansson sp. nov., Ophion sylvestris Johansson sp. nov., Ophion tenuicornis Johansson sp. nov. and Ophion vardali Johansson sp. nov. Barcoding analysis also indicated the possible presence of at least three additional, partly cryptic species, but these cannot be separated morphologically with certainty at this point. Ophion costatus Ratzeburg, 1848 and Ophion artemisiae Boie, 1855 are interpreted and defined. Ophion slaviceki Kriechbaumer, 1892 is excluded from synonymy with Ophion luteus Linnaeus, 1758 stat. rev. Ophion polyguttator (Thunberg, 1824) stat. rev. and Ophion variegatus Rudow, 1883 stat. rev. are excluded from synonymy with O. obscuratus Fabricius, 1798. Ophion variegatus is redescribed and a neotype is designated. Ophion albistylus Szepligeti, 1905 (syn. nov.) is synonymized with Ophion pteridis Kriechbaumer, 1879 and Ophion frontalis Strobl, 1904 (syn. nov.) is synonymized with Ophion areolaris Brauns, 1889 syn. nov. Eleven species are reported from Sweden for the first time: Ophion artemisiae, Ophion crassicornis Brock, 1982, Ophion costatus, Ophion dispar Brauns, 1895, Ophion forticornis Morley, 1915, Ophion kevoensis Jussila, 1965, Ophion ocellaris Ulbricht, 1926, Ophion perkinsi Brock, 1982, Ophion subarcticus Hellen, 1926, Ophion variegatus Rudow, 1883 and Ophion wuestneii Kriechbaumer, 1892. The study shows that a number of species that previously have been treated as highly variable taxa, actually consist of several valid species that are separable using morphological characters. An illustrated key for the determination of the Swedish Ophion species is provided.

First and foremost we are grateful to Nils Ryrholm & Claes Kallander for providing access to their unique sample series of MV-light trap material from three decades. Without the sheer number of specimens, this study would have been impossible. Hege Vardal at the NHRS has been absolutely crucial to this study in arranging the receipt and shipping of specimens, photographing important type-material and for access to the NHRS collections. Gavin Broad at the BMNH has been a very valuable source of taxonomic discussions as well as giving access to British specimens and type-material which has increased the quality of this study. Many people have donated material for study and more important contributions have been made by the following persons: Arne Pettersson, Michael Andersson, Birgitta Andersson, Artur Larsson, Hakan Andersson, Tommy Lindberg, Johan Tornvall, Martin Oomen, Robin Isaksson, Mats Lindeborg, Kenneth Alexandersson, Nikolay Savenkov and Conny Philipsson.

J	Liao, HC; Terayama, M; Eguchi, K				Liao, Hauchuan; Terayama, Mamoru; Eguchi, Katsuyuki			Revision of Taiwanese and Ryukyuan species of Propristocera (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), with description of a new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						flat wasp; Taiwan; Ryukyus; morphology; molecular phylogeny; male genitalia		The genus Propristocera Kieffer was very recently revived from the synonymy of the genus Apenesia Westwood, and consists of a total of 25 valid species recorded from the Afrotropical, Oriental and Palaearctic regions. Only two of its species, P. formosimonticola and P. pingtungensis, have been previously recorded from Taiwan. In this study, we examined species of Propristocera collected from Taiwan and the Ryukyus based on external morphology, male genital morphology and molecular phylogenetic analyses, gene markers: nuclear 28SrDNA, mitochondrial COI. In consequence, four species were recognized. Propristocera okinawensis had its record expanded from the Ryukyus to Taiwan, whereas P. kusigematii previously known from the Ryukyus was synonymized under P. pingtungensis, which was known from Taiwan. Furthermore, one new species, Propristocera seediq sp. nov., was discovered in Taiwan and the Ryukyus.

A new species of Girdled Lizard (Squamata: Cordylidae) from the Serra da Neve Inselberg, Namibe Province, southwestern Angola	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Cordylus phonolithos sp. nov.; molecular phylogeny; computed tomography; endemism; taxonomy; Africa	CONSERVATION; MOZAMBIQUE; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; REGIONS; AFRICA; SAURIA; MABU	A new species of rupicolous girdled lizard is described from Serra da Neve Inselberg, Namibe Province, southwestern Angola. We sequenced two mitochondrial gene regions (16S and ND2) for the new species and compared these data with those previously published for other Cordylus species. The new species is genetically divergent from the closely related Cordylus machadoi and C. namakuiyus and morphologically distinguished by head scale arrangement, coloration, and osteological characters. Serra da Neve is the second highest peak in Angola and one of the most understudied areas of the country. The discovery of this new species highlights the importance of this inselberg for regional endemism and emphasizes the high conservation importance of the area.

J	Chou, MH; Yeh, WB				Chou, Ming-Hsun; Yeh, Wen-Bin			Delineation of two new, highly similar species of Taiwanese Cylindera tiger beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Cicindelinae) based on morphological and molecular evidence	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						COI; key; new species; taxonomy; 16S rDNA; 28S rDNA	BODY-SIZE; DIVERGENCE TIME; PHYLOGENY; MEGACEPHALINI; GENETICS; HISTORY; COMPLEX	Tiger beetles have been recognized primarily based on morphological characters. However, the variations of elytral maculation and coloration sometimes lead to misjudgment in species classification and the overlooking of the existence of cryptic species. Recently, specimens of two endemic species of Taiwanese Cylindera, C. sauteri and C. pseudocylindriformis, exhibit morphologically recognizable forms, indicating that some undescribed species may exist. To clarify their taxonomic status, morphological characteristics including male genitalia were examined and two mitochondrial genes, COI and 16S rDNA, and one nuclear 28S rDNA were analyzed. Molecular phylogenetic inferences indicated that both forms in both species are reciprocally monophyletic. Moreover, molecular dating showed the forms diverged approximately 1.3 million years ago. Two new species, Cylindera ooa sp. nov. and Cylindera autumnalis sp. nov., are thereby described. The main recognizable characteristics separating C. ooa sp. nov. from C. sauteri are the lack of a triangular spot at the middle edge of elytron and the elongated but not rounded subapical spot. For C. autumnalis sp. nov., the apical lunula near the elytral suture is thickened but not linear and slender, and its elytra are more metallic brownish than those of C. pseudocylindriformis. Although their aedeagi characteristics are not distinctive, the body size of the proposed two new species is different. Field observation revealed that niche utilization would be relevant for differentiating these closely related species.

J	Wheeler, TA; Sinclair, BJ				Wheeler, Terry A.; Sinclair, Bradley J.			Systematics of Paraleucopis Malloch with proposal of Paraleucopidae, a new family of acalyptrate Diptera	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						systematics; Neotropical; Nearctic; new family; new species		Paraleucopidae Wheeler fam. nov. is proposed for the previously unplaced New World genera Paraleucopis Malloch, Mallochianamyia Santos-Neto and Schizostomyia Malloch and undescribed Australian species. A key to genera of Paraleucopidae is provided. Paraleucopis is revised and includes nine species: P. auripes Wheeler & Sinclair sp. nov. (type locality: Andalgala, Argentina); P. bispinosa Wheeler & Sinclair sp. nov. (type locality: Socos, Coquimbo, Chile); P. boharti Wheeler & Sinclair sp. nov. (type locality: Andalgala, Argentina); P. boydensis Steyskal (type locality: nr. Palm Desert, California, USA); P. corvina Malloch (type species of genus; type locality: New Mexico, USA); P. mexicana Steyskal (type locality: Kino Bay, Mexico); P. nigra Wheeler & Sinclair sp. nov. (type locality: Portal, Arizona, USA); P. paraboydensis Wheeler & Sinclair sp. nov. (type locality: Willis Palms Oasis, California, USA); P. saguaro Wheeler & Sinclair sp. nov. (type locality: Usery Mtn Park, Arizona, USA). A key to the species of Paraleucopis is provided. The distribution of Paraleucopis is disjunct, with six species in the western United States and northwestern Mexico and three species in northern Chile and northern Argentina. The sister group and superfamilial assignment of the Paraleucopidae cannot be established based on current knowledge although the family has affinities to some families of the Asteioinea sensu J.F. McAlpine. A well-supported hypothesis on the relationships of the families of the Acalyptratae will be required before the sister group relationships of Paraleucopidae can be determined.

Some Cheilostomata (Bryozoa) from the Java Sea, central Indonesian Archipelago, with a description of Pleurocodonellina jeparaensis n. sp. (Smittinidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Licornia; Poricellaria; Smittipora; Celleporaria; Triphyllozoon; new species	EAST KALIMANTAN; MIOCENE BRYOZOA; DIVERSITY	The Java Sea region has a high diversity of marine organisms of interest to scientists and tourists alike. Neglected among this diversity are intertidal bryozoans, relatively few of which have been reported from this area. Here we describe six species, one of which is new to science. These were collected from three shallow-water localities-Karimunjawa Marine National Park, Awur Bay and Panjang Island-in the south-central part of the sea. The five known species belong to the families Candidae, Poricellariidae, Onychocellidae, Lepraliellidae, and Phidoloporidae. The new species, Pleurocodonellina jeparaensis n. sp. (Smittinidae), is found at Awur Bay, attached to a bivalve shell fragment. Biogeographically, the suite of species is predominantly tropical Indo-West Pacific in distribution, representing a small fraction of the additional hundreds of species that are anticipated for the Java Sea region.

Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Trypanosoma and Leucocytozoon were found. The Haemoproteus were the most frequent haematozoa present in the blood. Two new species of Haemoproteus ? Haemoproteus obainae n. sp. and Haemoproteus deharoi n. sp. ? in the blood of Falco subbuteo and F. tinnunculus, respectively, are described. In addition, two previously known species were observed and identified, according to their original description ? Haemoproteus brachiatus and Haemoproteus tinnunculi ? which were also observed in samples from Israel and used for comparison. The frequency of birds poly-parasitised by two or more species of Haemoproteus was high. Multiple infections by several species of haemoproteids in birds are often overlooked. They are responsible for errors of parasite identification and misinterpretations of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based results, i.e. sequence assignment to the corresponding species. The discussion deals with the taxonomy of the haemoproteids based on the morphology and biology and the complementary data (i.e. some bias) provided by the use of PCR-based methods. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FB26BDF1-67C1-40FB-874E-A63834CEC79D	[Puech, Marie-Pierre] Hop Faune Sauvage Garrigues & Cevennes Goupil Con, F-34190 Brissac, France; [Chavatte, Jean-Marc; Landau, Irene; Karadjian, Gregory] MNHN, CNRS, Adaptat Vivant, UMR MCAM 7245, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Karadjian, Gregory] French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth & Safety, UMR BIPAR, Anses, ENVA,Lab Anim Hlth, F-94701 Maisons Alfort, France; [Chavatte, Jean-Marc] Natl Ctr Infect Dis, Natl Publ Hlth Lab, Malaria Reference Ctr, Block G,Level 13,16 Jalan Tan Tock Seng, Singapore 308442, Singapore	Karadjian, G (reprint author), MNHN, CNRS, Adaptat Vivant, UMR MCAM 7245, F-75231 Paris 05, France.; Karadjian, G (reprint author), French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth & Safety, UMR BIPAR, Anses, ENVA,Lab Anim Hlth, F-94701 Maisons Alfort, France.	gregory.karadjian@anses.fr		Chavatte, Jean-Marc/0000-0002-0003-541X				42	0	0	9	9	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0022-2933	1464-5262		J NAT HIST	J.

New species of deep-water Calcigorgia gorgonians (Anthozoa: Octocorallia) from the Sea of Okhotsk, with a re-diagnosis and a taxonomic review of the genus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Review						Calcigorgia herba sp. nov.; Calcigorgia lukini sp. nov.; taxonomy; sclerites; distribution	CORALS; CNIDARIA; BIOLOGY; ALCYONACEA	This paper provides descriptions of two new species of Calcigorgia gorgonians collected from the Sea of Okhotsk between 1973 and 2008. The new species are Calcigorgia herba sp. nov. and.. lukini sp. nov., belonging to the deep-water coral fauna of the temperate Northern Pacific. The taxonomy structure of the genus is reviewed and a comparative table is provided for all known species of Calcigorgia. The following taxonomic changes are made: the diagnosis of the genus was corrected from that given in Matsumoto et al. (2019); synonymization of C. simushiri Dautova, 2018 with C. spiculifera Broch, 1935 and inclusion of additional specimens in C. japonica Dautova, 2007 (both performed by Matsumoto et al. 2019) are assumed erroneous. The finding of previously undescribed species emphasizes the need for further surveys, particularly in deeper waters, to improve knowledge of the Octocorallia fauna in Far East seas. The distribution of Calcigorgia (Octocorallia, Acanthogorgiidae) is reviewed and presented based on field and collection studies published since 1935 as well as miscellaneous data from previous literature.

More than 99% of the known species of this genus are endemic to the island environment. Only three species are currently known to occur on the mainland. Here we describe a new sinistral Satsuma species from China, Satsuma guandi n. sp. We studied the shell morphology and genital anatomy of the new species and reconstructed the molecular phylogeny of the genus based on partial nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and nuclear markers from the ribosomal RNA cistrons (the internal transcribed spacer and the external transcribed spacer regions). The new species differs from other sinistral Satsuma species by having a strongly angulated shell and an open dark brownish-red umbilicus.

The new species is differentiated from its congeners by a combination of the following characters: dorsal scales in 17-17-15 rows, smooth throughout; supralabials usually eight (rarely nine); infralabials ten; one elongated loreal on each side, in contact with the eye; precloacal plate single; ventral scales 212-218 (plus one or two preventral scales); subcaudals 90 or 91; maxillary teeth 13 or 14; dorsal surface of body with 28 or 29 light body bands; dorsal surface of tail with 13 cream bands, forming a distinct blotch in the vertebral region. Based on phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data, the new species is recovered as the sister species to a clade containing L. multizonatus and L. liuchengchaoi with strong support from the Bayesian analysis. The new species is at least 7.5% divergent from other species within this clade in uncorrected pairwise distance calculated using a fragment of more than 1000 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b. This discovery increases the number of Lycodon species known from Vietnam to 16.

J	Lacerda, DSS; Machado, ABM				Soldati Lacerda, Deborah S.; Monteiro Machado, Angelo B.			The damselfly genus Mecistogaster (Odonata: Pseudostigmatidae) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with a description of three new species and a neotype designation for M. amalia (Burmeister, 1839)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						damselflies; phenology; taxonomy; Zygoptera	LIFE	Mecistogaster Rambur, 1842 is a genus of Pseudostigmatidae with five species distributed from Mexico to Argentina. Four of these occur in Brazil, two of which were recorded on the Atlantic Forest, M. amalia (Burmeister, 1839) and M. linearis (Fabricius, 1776). After examining 140 specimens of Mecistogaster amalia it was possible to conclude that it is a complex of species and three new species are described, M. kesselringi sp. nov., M. mielkei sp. nov. and M. nordestina sp. nov. The males differ from each other mainly by the presence or absence of alula, the area occupied by the reddish-brown color of the mesepimeron and penis structure. The females differ mainly by the region occupied for the pale apical area of wing and epiproct shape. The problem of Burmeister's type of M. amalia is discussed and a neotype is erected for it. Distribution and phenology data are provided. A key for males recorded from Brazilian Atlantic Forest is presented.

The genus Deanophlebia is established for the species: Deanophlebia kala (Harker) (comb nov.) and Deanophlebia radsjoshi (sp. nov.), both of which were first found in the alpine regions of New South Wales but with a range which extends into East Gippsland in Victoria. The genus can be distinguished from Nousia by the consistently larger size of both the imagos and nymphs. Furthermore, fore and hind wing venation and genitalia morphology are characteristic in the imago as is mouthpart morphology in the nymph. Differences between Deanophlebia and Nousia are defined and discussed and differences between the subgenera of Nousia are re-defined.	[Finlay, K.

Combining morphological and genomic evidence to resolve species diversity and study speciation processes of the Pallenopsis patagonica (Pycnogonida) species complex	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Sea spider; Marine benthos; Antarctica; Patagonia; Integrative taxonomy; Target hybrid enrichment; Cryptic species; Selection	COLOSSENDEIS-MEGALONYX HOEK; SEA SPIDERS ARTHROPODA; OPEN-OCEAN BARRIERS; MITOCHONDRIAL LINEAGES; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; EVOLUTIONARY; DIVERSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; GLACIATION	Background Pallenopsis patagonica (Hoek, 1881) is a morphologically and genetically variable sea spider species whose taxonomic classification is challenging. Currently, it is considered as a species complex including several genetic lineages, many of which have not been formally described as species. Members of this species complex occur on the Patagonian and Antarctic continental shelves as well as around sub-Antarctic islands. These habitats have been strongly influenced by historical large-scale glaciations and previous studies suggested that communities were limited to very few refugia during glacial maxima. Therefore, allopatric speciation in these independent refugia is regarded as a common mechanism leading to high biodiversity of marine benthic taxa in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere. However, other mechanisms such as ecological speciation have rarely been considered or tested. Therefore, we conducted an integrative morphological and genetic study on the P. patagonica species complex to i) resolve species diversity using a target hybrid enrichment approach to obtain multiple genomic markers, ii) find morphological characters and analyze morphometric measurements to distinguish species, and iii) investigate the speciation processes that led to multiple lineages within the species complex. Results Phylogenomic results support most of the previously reported lineages within the P. patagonica species complex and morphological data show that several lineages are distinct species with diagnostic characters. Two lineages are proposed as new species, P. aulaeturcarum sp. nov. Domel & Melzer, 2019 and P. obstaculumsuperavit sp. nov. Domel, 2019, respectively. However, not all lineages could be distinguished morphologically and thus likely represent cryptic species that can only be identified with genetic tools. Further, morphometric data of 135 measurements showed a high amount of variability within and between species without clear support of adaptive divergence in sympatry. Conclusions We generated an unprecedented molecular data set for members of the P. patagonica sea spider species complex with a target hybrid enrichment approach, which we combined with extensive morphological and morphometric analyses to investigate the taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of this group. The extensive data set enabled us to delineate species boundaries, on the basis of which we formally described two new species. No consistent evidence for positive selection was found, rendering speciation in allopatric glacial refugia as the most likely model of speciation.

The known fauna of Canada includes 556 identified species in 247 genera, and that of Alaska includes 182 species in 95 genera; 39 of the 42 oribatid superfamilies are represented. We further list similar to 300 species that are currently unidentified, and possibly undescribed. In addition, we list 42 genera that are represented only by unidentified and probably undescribed species. For each species we give combinations and synonymies, specific locations in Alaska and the Provinces and Territories of Canada. habitats, and biogeography. There are 182 identified species known for Alaska, 152 for Yukon, 122 for Northwest Territories, 58 for Nunavut; 210 for British Columbia, 213 for Alberta, 15 for Saskatchewan, 84 for Manitoba, 167 for Ontario, 210 for Quebec, 110 for Nova Scotia, 77 for New Brunswick, 84 for Newfoundland and 6 for Prince Edward Island. The known fauna of Canada is smaller than that of Austria, and is approximately equivalent to that of the Czech Republic. As these countries are much smaller in size than Canada and less ecologically diverse, we consider the Canadian and Alaskan fauna are at most 25% known. The paucity of these data reflects the absence of taxonomic and faunistic studies on Oribatida in State, Provinces or Territories, and especially in the Canadian and Alaskan National Park systems and the hundreds of Provincial Parks. Despite the almost 90% increase in described species since the catalogue of Marshall et al. (1987), there is a need for focussed, coordinated research on Oribatida in the natural regions throughout Canada and Alaska, and for monographs on families and genera with large numbers of undescribed species, such as Brachychthoniidae, Damaeidae, Cepheidae, Liacaridae, Oppiidae, Suctobelbidae, Hydrozetidae, Phenopelopidae, Scheloribatidae, Haplozetidae and Galumnidae.

The Lycoriella (Hemineurina) inflata group, including the type species of the subgenus, Sciara conspicua Winnertz, 1867, is treated as the genus Hemineurina stat. n. and the Lycoriella (Hemineurina) vitticollis group as the genus Trichocoelina gen. n. (type species Sciara vitticollis Holmgren, 1883). Coelostylina Tuomikoski, 1960 (type species Lycoriella (Coelostylina)freyi Tuomikoski, 1960) is a junior homonym of Coelostylina Kittl, 1894, and is renamed Stenacanthella nom. et stat. n. The genera are diagnosed and their phylogeny is discussed. Eight species are excluded from the Lycoriella group. They are transferred to the genera Bradysiopsis Tuomikoski, 1960, Camptochaeta Hippa & Vilkamaa, 1994, Merizomma Sasakawa, 2003 stat. n. and Scatopsciara Edwards, 1927 (five species) or are for the time being regarded as incertae sedis (two species) and as nomen nudum (one name). Numerous nomenclatural corrections are made also in the genera Hemineurina Frey, Stenacanthella Vilkamaa & Menzel and Trichocoelina Vilkamaa & Menzel. Altogether 42 new combinations, three changes in status and one new synonym are presented. A lectotype is designated for Hemineurina algida (Frey, 1948) and two Hemineurina species names are removed from synonymy and given full species status. The following species of Trichocoelina are newly described: Trichocoelina absidata sp. n. (Russia: Krasnodarsk region), T aemula sp. n. (Finland, Russia: Krasnodarsk region), T biplex sp. n. (Canada: Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon), T dicksoni sp. n. (Russia: Arkhangelsk oblast, Kemerovsk oblast, Krasnodarsk region), T dispansa sp. n. (Russia: Krasnodarsk region), T dividua sp. n. (Canada: Northwest Territories), T hians sp. n. (Canada: Yukon), T imitator sp. n. (Canada: Yukon), T incrassata sp. n. (USA: Alaska), T ithyspina sp. n. (Norway), T jukkai sp. n. (Finland), T magnifica sp. n. (Canada . Yukon), T nefrens sp. n. (Russia: Krasnodarsk region), T obesula sp. n. (Norway), T oricillifera sp. n. (Finland, Norway), T planilobata sp. n. (Finland), T quintula sp. n. (Finland), T semisphaera sp. n. (Finland, Norway), T semusta sp. n. (Italy, USA: Alaska), and T tecta sp. n. (Canada: Nunavut, Yukon, Russia: Krasnodarsk region, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, USA: Alaska). The Trichocoelina species are keyed, the 20 new species are described and illustrated, and the 9 previously known ones, transferred to the new genus, are briefly diagnosed and the taxonomically relevant literature regarding them is listed. Trichocoelina janetscheki (Lengersdorf, 1953) comb. n. and Trichocoelina brevicubitalis (Lengersdorf, 1926) comb. n. are redescribed. The genus Trichocoelina currently includes 29 species: 17 in the Palaearctic, 6 in the Nearctic and 6 in the Holarctic. All known species are northern or montane.

It would have been impossible to gain an understanding of the genus without the rich recent collections from Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. The Peruvian collections were made possible by access to the incredible habitats of Wayqecha Biological Station. I thank ACCA (Asociacion para la Conservacion de la Cuenca Amazonica) for hosting me at Wayqecha in 2016, and Allen Norrbom for arranging appropriate permits for our fly collecting during that visit, as well as providing me with specimens from his subsequent trips to Peru. The several Ecuadorian collections were made thanks to help with permits and other arrangements by Giovanni Onore and Clifford Keil at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador and facilitated by access to the rich forests of the Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve. Most of the Bolivian specimens are from a 2001 expedition organized by Stephen Gaimari. The most significant recent collections of Mesoconius other than my own are those from Colombia made available to me by Michael Sharkey and Brian Brown. I thank Mike and Brian for sending this material, and I thank the Humboldt Institute for allowing me to study the Micropezidae from those collections for the decade or so that it took to revise this difficult genus. Amnon Friedberg kindly sent me his collection of Mexican Micropezidae, including the unexpected new species of Mesoconius described herein. Steven Paiero assisted in many ways, Valerie Levesque-Beaudin helped with arranging CO1 sequencing, Michael Balke offered advice on interpreting the sequence data and Ken Stead funded some of the sequencing. Most of this work was supported through the NSERC discovery grant program.		16	0	0	0	0	MUSEUM NATL HISTOIRE NATURELLE	PARIS	SERVICE PUBLICATIONS SCIENTIFIQUES, 57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE	2118-9773			EUR J TAXON	Eur.

Integrated Taxonomy Using Morphology and DNA Sequences: Reporting Variation Within the antofagastensis Lineage	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES			English	Article						Phymaturus fiambala sp. nov.; Taxonomy; Squamata; Liolaemidae; Argentina	IGUANIA LIOLAEMIDAE; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; CLIMATE; CLADE	The northernmost distributed group of lizards belonging to Phymaturus occurs in rocky outcrops of the Puna region between 3600-4200 m in Argentina. In a recent phylogenetic study based on morphological and genetic information, the monophyly of this small lineage was corroborated. This group is formed by Phymaturus antofagastensis, P. laurenti, P. denotatus, P. mallimaccii and a population of uncertain taxonomic status until the present study. After obtaining new samples and observations, we described a new species belonging to this lineage that is known only from Sierra de Fiambala, being the species of Phymaturus living at the highest elevation ever recorded (4500 m). Males have a homogeneous yellow dorsum and lack melanic coloration over their heads, a phenomenon found in males of most species of the palluma group. We provide a detailed diagnosis, including characters from the squamation, coloration and significant differences found among continuous characters (ANOVA). Furthermore, we present genetic distances among members of the mallimaccii subclade based on sequences of the cytb marker. We provide color photos showing pattern variation of males and females. We reanalyze the phylogenetic relationships within the entire palluma group and update info on all members of the antofagastensis lineage based on new samples and make a better supported hypothesis. We also evaluate the phylogenetic position of the new taxon.

First South American record of the rare ichneumonoid subfamily Masoninae van Achterberg (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea: Ichneumonidae) with description of a new species from Brazil	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						apterous; plesiomorphic; neotropics; Atlantic forest; Winkler sample		Masona popeye Quicke & Chaul sp. n. is described from Brazil, and differentiated from other species of the genus. Described extant species of Masona are known from Australia and south eastern U.S.A. (Georgia and Florida including the Key Islands). Two undescribed species are known from Tanzania and Cambodia. The new species is therefore the first representative of the subfamily Masoninae van Achterberg from South America, demonstrating the completely cosmopolitan distribution of this very poorly known group. The new species most closely resembles a fossil species, M. pyriceps van Achterberg, 2001, from Dominican amber with which it shares the plesiomorphic presence of a scutellum.	[Quicke, Donald L.

J	Hemp, C; Heller, KG				Hemp, Claudia; Heller, Klaus-Gerhard			New Agraeciini species from the Eastern Arc Mountains, East Africa (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae; Conocephalinae; Agraeciini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						New species; Eastern Arc Mountains; speciation; acoustics; East Africa	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; KARNIELLINA ORTHOPTERA; CLIMATIC FLUCTUATIONS; SPECIATION; GENERA; GENUS	Eleven new Agraeciini species are described. Six species of Afroanthracites are new to science from the North and South Pare, the West and East Usambara, the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, and the Taita Hills of Kenya. The two Afroanthracites Hemp & Ingrisch, 2013 species from the Pare Mountains, A. guttatus n. sp. and A. maculatus n. sp., and A. magamba n. sp., from Maga tuba Forest Reserve in the West Usambara Mountains are morphologically closely related to each other and form a morphological lineage with the already described species from the West Usambara Mountains (A. discolor Hemp, Ingrisch & Unal, 2013 and A. pseudodiscolor Hemp. 2015) andA. pommeri n. sp. from the Taita. Hills of Kenya. A. lineatus n. sp. from Lutindi Forest Reserve in the East Usambara Mountains has its morphologically closest relative in A. jagoi Unal & Hemp, 2013 endemic to the Mazumbai Forest Reserve of the West Usambara Mountains while A. montium (Sjostedt, 1910) from the Kilimanjaro/Meru area, A. inopinatus n. sp. from the South Pare Mountains and A. usambaricus (Sjostedt, 1913) from the West Usambara Mountains form another morphological lineage. Morphological traits like the shape of the last abdominal tergite in males, the male cerci and the colour pattern suggest at least two lineages reflecting dispersal of the ancestors at a time when forest connected the mountain ranges in the past during climatic fluctuations. In the genus Afroagraecia Ingrisch & Hemp, 2013 new species were collected on Zanzibar and in Kazimzumbwi Forest Reserve, the Udzungwa and Nguru Mountains. Distribution patterns and the morphology suggest recent speciation patterns of Afroagraecia in the Eastern Arc Mountains and along the Tanzanian coast. From the Ngtuu Mountains a third Dendrobia species of the genus, D. plagata n. sp., is described.

The geographical distribution and preferred hosts of these nematodes are reviewed in the present paper. Most genera in Ataloderinae are believed to have evolved in North America, but some genera currently show different or wider distributions. Although members of Bellodera, Ekphymatodera, Rhizonemella and Sarisodera have only been recovered from North America, those of Atalodera may be found in both North America and South America. Species of the other genera tend to occur in different geographical locations: Cryphodera species have been recorded in Asia and Oceania while Camelodera and Hylonema species have only reported from Asia and Africa, respectively. Members of Meloidoderinae (Meloidodera spp.) are distributed in North America, Asia and Europe. Plant hosts for the cystoid nematodes are distributed among both monocots and dicots. Nematologists suggest an ancient origin for genera such as Meloidodera, Cryphodera and Rhizonemella which can parasitize gymnosperms.

A. demptus belongs to Amynthas hawayanus-group and has three pails of spermathecal pores in 5/6-7/8. A. lacustris belongs to Amynthas morrisi-group and has two pairs of spermathecal pores in 5/6-6/7. M. reclusa has no spermathecal pores. A. demptus has no male pores. The male pores of A. lacustris are about 1/3 body circumference ventrally apart, with a presetal and a postsetal papilla medial to each pore, surrounded with two circular folds. The male pores of M. reclusa are in copulatory chambers at XVIII, with openings of copulatory chambers about 1/3 body circumference ventrally apart. In this paper, the morphological characters of the three new species are described. We also sequenced COI and 12S gene fragments of the holotypes and selected paratype specimens to provide molecular data.

We describe two new species of viviparous neotropical gyrodactylids parasitizing the introduced poeciliid, Cnesterodon decemmaculatus (Jenyns, 1842) (Poeciliidae), from southern Argentina: Gyrodactylus decemmaculati n. sp. and Gyrodactylus breviradix n. sp. The new species differ from other gyrodactylids parasitizing poeciliids in the morphology of superficial bars and hooklets. Gyrodactylus decemmaculati n. sp. has a superficial bar with two robust and rounded anterolateral projections (each with a ventral lobe), and a subtriangular shield, and has a slender hooklet with a delicate recurred point, a straight, elongate shaft, and a depressed, acute toe. Gyrodactylus breviradix n. sp. has a superficial bar with two robust, elongate anterolateral projections, folded inward, and a trapezoidal shield, and has a hooklet with a short point, angled at 900, ending before level of toe tip, a straight, short shaft, a round, prominent heel, and a pointed, depressed toe. These identifications were supported by DNA analyses based on sequences of the ITS2 region and a barcoding gap analysis.

This is the second known species of the genus in the eastern Atlantic, and the third species in the Atlantic as the whole. The new species is more closely related to the western Atlantic C. manningi, both having quadrispinose ambulatory dactyli (i.e. with unguis + 3 ventral spinules), but differs from the latter by the presence of an arthrobranch on the three anterior pereiopods (vs only on the first pereiopod in C. manningi). The branchial formula of the new species is consistent with most of the Indo-West Pacific congeners, and with the amphi-Atlantic C. rigens; the latter possessing trispinose ambulatory dactyli. Other distinctions of the new species from its congeners are in the carpal and meral spinulation of the ambulatory legs, and in the posterolateral and posteroventral armament of pleomeres IV and V. Cinetorhynchus gabonensis sp. n. differs from both known Atlantic congeners also by a specific colour pattern which is dense deep-red mottled with a pair of small white spots delineated by deep-red broad rings on the top of the third pleomere.

C. pararoseus sp. n. can be recognized by having a kidney-shaped body, a complete cross-striated band, 44-51 somatic kinetics, and 11-14 nematodesmal rods. The other three species were re-described based on new populations. Additionally, the SSU rRNA genes of C. pararoseus sp. n. and D. monostyla were sequenced for the first time. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from SSU rRNA gene sequences reveal that C. pararoseus sp. n. has a close relationship with C. bourlandi and C. mnemosyne Gong et al., 2005 within the genus Chlamydodon; and D. monostyla and D. crassipes cluster with its congeners, which confirms their generic assignments.

In Thailand alone, there have been recent reports of new species in the genus Macrobrachium. Morphological differentiation and, recently, DNA sequence differences have been used to distinguish new species from valid ones. Macrobrachium chainatense (Decapoda: Palaemonidae), a small freshwater prawn found in Thailand, is now established as a new species based on both morphological and genetic criteria. Among Thailand Macrobrachium prawns, M. chainatense has smallest body size, largest egg size, and 3-5 teeth on the cutting edges. The most closely related Macrobrachium species to M. chainatense in terms of COI and 18S DNA sequences is M. niphanae. Their COI sequences differ by 7.3% while their 18S sequences are basically identical in all but one site. Observations of some aspects of this prawn in captivity are also utilized to establish its unique species status. This prawn may be useful as a source of cooked food for human consumption.

Liphistius thaleban Schwendinger, 1990 and L. rufipes Schwendinger, 1995 are placed in the synonymy of L. yangae Platnick & Sedgwick, 1984. The previously unknown male of L. kanthan Platnick, in Platnick et al., 1997 is described for the first time. Liphistius kanthan and L. tempurung Platnick, in Platnick et al., 1997 are reported to occur together at the Tempurung Cave. Liphistius buran Schwendinger, sp. nov., an island species with a novel character of the palpal organ, is described from males and females. Information on and illustrations of intraspecific variation in most of these species is given together with data on biology and distribution. For selected Liphistius species in Malaysia a phylogenetic tree based on an analysis of COI sequences is presented and discussed in comparison with relationships inferred from morphological characters. Molecular data confirm the distinction between the malayanus-group and the trang-group in Malaysia, but, unlike an earlier interpretation of morphological evolution of genitalia, place species of the trang-group as basal to the malayanus-group.

Revision of Achilia Reitter, 1890: A. cornuta, A. spinifer, A. cribratifrons, and A. monstrata species groups (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae)	REVUE SUISSE DE ZOOLOGIE			English	Article						Achilia; Chile; taxonomy; new species; distribution		The A. cornuta, A. spinifer, A. cribratifrons, and A. monstrata species groups sensu Jeannel (1962) of the species-rich genus Achilia Reitter, 1890 are revised. Of the ten taxa placed in these four groups of species, two belong to different groups and will be treated in a subsequent part of our revision of Achilia (i.e. A. caneloi Franz, 1996 and A. simpsoni Franz, 1996 with the A. cosmoptera and the A. bicornis groups, respectively), two names are placed in synonymy - A. parangulifrons Franz, 1996 = A. lobifera Jeannel, 1962 syn. nov., and A. monstrata chilota Jeannel, 1962 = Achilia monstrata (Reitter, 1885) syn. nov. - and A. pseudangulifrons Franz, 1996 is considered as a species inquirenda. The remaining five species are redescribed, and the new species Achilia pullastra n. sp., attributed to the A. spinifer group, and Achilia pugila n. sp., attributed to the A. cribratifrons group, are described. For all these species the distribution is detailed and mapped, and habitat/collecting data are summarized.

SP; ZOOTHAMNIUM; CHINA; VORTICELLA; EHRENBERG; GENERA	The classification of loricate peritrich ciliates is difficult because of an accumulation of several taxonomic problems. In the present work, three poorly described vaginicolids, Pyxicola pusilla, Cothurnia ceramicola and Vaginicola tincta, were isolated from the surface of two freshwater/marine algae in China. In our study, the ciliature of Pyxicola and Vaginicola is revealed for the first time, demonstrating the taxonomic value of infundibular polykineties. The small subunit rDNA, ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 region and large subunit rDNA of the above species were sequenced for the first time. Phylogenetic analyses based on these genes indicated that Pyxicola and Cothurnia are closely related. The present study suggested that the loricate species probably represent a distinct lineage in peritrich evolution and both genera Cothurnia and Thuricola are monophyletic. Pyxicola pusilla, Cothurnia ceramicola and Vaginicola tincta are recircumscribed.

NOV; REVISION; EVOLUTION; QUEDIINA; LINEAGE; RECLASSIFICATION; ZOOGEOGRAPHY; TEMPERATURES	Cenozoic climate cooling, particularly during the Eocene, has drastically shaped modern biological assemblages through a shift from an equable greenhouse to a polarized icehouse. Present-day Europe lies in a highly seasonal and temperate area that strongly embodies this modern icehouse climate. Baltic amber provides a Middle Eocene snapshot of the European fauna before this large-scale change. Here, we focused on the rove beetle tribe Staphylinini and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic study of all known Baltic amber fossils in a total-evidence phylogenetic framework that integrates morphology with molecular data from six gene fragments. Based on our well-resolved topology, we propose the following: dagger Baltognathina subtrib. nov., Afroquediina subtrib. nov., Antimerina subtrib. nov., dagger Baltognathus aenigmaticus gen. et sp. nov., dagger Eolophorus gen. nov., dagger Laevisaurus robustus and dagger Laevisaurus gracilis gen. et spp. nov., dagger Hemiquedius europaeus sp. nov. and dagger Bolitogyrus fragmentus sp. nov. dagger Quedius cretaceus is placed as junior synonym of dagger Cretoquedius infractus. The earliest definitive fossils of Quediina are reported herein from the Eocene. The Staphylinini fauna of Middle Eocene Europe combined thermophilic, freeze-intolerant lineages with freeze-tolerant, temperate lineages and, unlike most other staphylinid or beetle lineages, all have since become extinct in the Palaearctic region.

Ten species were found, all of them being new to Vietnam. Spine scales of Acanthocystis turfacea were characteristically distinguished by conically narrowed tips of the furcae and longer furcae of the long spine scales relative to the length of the shaft. Morphologically, the plate scales observed in Pterocystis tropica correspond to these of the subspecies P. tropica paucistriata, while the spine scales to those of the subspecies P. tropica tropica. The plate scales observed in Raineriophrys erinaceoides undulata do not have radial slits, in contrast to those given in the original description. Two new species of centrohelid heliozoans are described. Pterocystis vietnamica sp. n. shows leaf-shaped spine scales with transverse slits on the lateral wings and a large, spherical, subapical protrusion. Pseudoraphidocystis dentata sp. n. has marginal teeth at the edges of funnel-shaped spine scales.	[Prokina, K. I.; Radaykina, L. V.; MyInikmov, A.

Although germ-free animals were first described more than 100 y ago, little evidence-based guidance is available on best operational procedures. A key aspect of gnotobiotic technology is the sterilization of animal enclosures, most commonly flexible vinyl film isolators. The objective of this study was to determine the most effective methods for chemical sterilization of gnotobiotic isolators and associated equipment. As test microbes, we used bacteria from 4 different accidental isolator contaminations that occurred in a gnotobiotic core facility. Identification by 16S ribotyping revealed facultative anaerobic firmicutes, including several Paenibacillus and Bacillus species, and obligate aerobic actinobacteria, namely Micrococcus luteus, among the contaminants. We selected 6 products commonly used for disinfecting hospital rooms, kitchens, and veterinary facilities to represent chlorine-oxideand peroxide-based disinfectants and tested the hypothesis that these 2 classes are equally effective. However, evaluation of bactericidal and sporicidal activity in liquid cultures revealed that chlorine oxide-based disinfectants were more effective than peroxide-based disinfectants. In both groups, various products effectively sterilized gnotobiotic isolators by fogging in field tests, although bactericidal concentrations were markedly higher than those in suspension cultures, and effectiveness was contact-time-dependent. In addition, in both groups, some disinfectants were excessively corrosive to ferrous metals and acrylic. These results demonstrate that no single disinfectant has all desirable properties and that the different characteristics of disinfectants must be balanced during their selection. However, chlorine oxide-based disinfectants were generally more effective and less corrosive than peroxide-based products.

These parasites cause tissue atrophy to the infected fish. In the present study, five (16.66%) out of 30 examined specimens of Pagrus major (Sparidae) captured off Jizan, the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, showed natural microsporidian infection. The parasite formed tumor masses or plasmodia in the muscle tissue and the intestinal epithelium of the peritoneum. The microsporidium was characterised by light as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Light microscopy studies showed xenomas encircled by a fibrous layer enclosing the various developmental stages. Mature spores were 1.7 +/- 0.6 (1.5-2.7) mu m long and 1.5 +/- 0.3 (1.2-1.8) mu m wide, with an apparent posterior vacuole. Examination of ultrathin sections by TEM revealed the presence of uninucleated spores with anterior lamellar polaroplast and lateral 5-8 polar filament coils with electron dense centre. Generative cells were the early recognised stages underneath the surface coat, followed by uninucleated, binucleated, multinucleated meronts, sporoblasts and finally immature and mature spores. Xenomas as well as developmental stages of the parasite compared with microsporidian species recorded previously form different geographical areas, showed that the microsporidium belonged to Pleistophora pagri described from Pagrus pagrus.

A review of Caribbean Copepoda associated with reef-dwelling cnidarians, echinoderms and sponges	CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY			English	Review						Crustacea; Cnidaria; Echinodermata; Porifera; reefs, diversity; symbiosis; parasitism	SPECIES COPEPODA; CYCLOPOID COPEPODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ST EUSTATIUS; CORAL-REEFS; N. SP.; SIPHONOSTOMATOIDA; HOST; ASTEROCHERES; GENUS	This review of copepod crustaceans associated with reef-dwelling cnidarians, sponges and echinoderms of the Greater Caribbean is based on published records, systematically arranged by the classification of symbiotic copepods and their hosts, sampling sites, coordinates, depth and date of sampling, literature sources, and three recent surveys (Cuba, St. Eustatius in the Eastern Caribbean and Curacao in the Southern Caribbean). This resulted in totals of 532 records of 115 species of symbiotic copepods (47 genera, 17 families, three orders) hosted by 80 species of invertebrates, representing scleractinians (47%), octocorals (9%), echinoderms (3%), and sponges (1%). Among ten Caribbean ecoregions, the Greater Antilles (with 64 species of symbiotic copepods) as well as the Southern and Eastern Caribbean (with 46 and 17 species of copepods, respectively) are the most studied and best represented, whereas only six species of copepods are known from Bermuda, one from Southwestern Caribbean and none from the Gulf of Mexico. The absence of poecilostomatoid copepods (Anchimolgidae, Rhynchomolgidae and Xarifidae) on Caribbean stony corals as noted by Stock (1988) is confirmed. The results indicate that the diversity and ecology of Caribbean symbiotic copepods are still poorly investigated.

The new species is morphologically most similar to R. paulexa (Martin & Shank, 2005), but the presence of numerous short setae scattered on the carapace surface, the relatively long antennular stylocerite usually reaching the distal margin of article 2 of the antennular peduncle and the spiniform posteromesial projection of the uropodal protopod distinguish the new species from all congeners. Genetic analysis using the barcoding region of the mitochondrial COI gene supports the recognition of the species as new.

Systematics of Haloniscus Chilton, 1920 (Isopoda: Oniscidea: Philosciidae), with description of four new species from threatened Great Artesian Basin springs in South Australia	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Andricophiloscia; arid zones; conservation; groundwater; integrated taxonomy	PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; ENDEMICITY; DIVERSITY; AMPHIPODS	Recent surveys of Australian arid-zone groundwater ecosystems have uncovered considerable species diversity and extreme endemism for the oniscidean isopod genus Haloniscus Chilton, 1920. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses have recognised several distinct species from the Great Artesian Basin springs in South Australia, inspiring a morphological reassessment of the genus and examination of specimens from the iconic Lake Eyre and Dalhousie Springs. We present a revised diagnosis of Haloniscus, transfer the genus from the family Scyphacidae to Philosciidae and describe four new species, H. fontanus Stringer, King & Taiti n. sp., H. microphthalmus Stringer, King & Taiti n. sp., H. rotundus Stringer, King & Taiti n. sp., and H. yardiyaensis Stringer, King & Taiti n. sp., based on combined morphological and molecular evidence. We compare the results of molecular-based species delimitation analyses with morphological data, provide distribution information, and present a key to the described species of Haloniscus. Two species presently included in Andricophiloscia Vandel, 1973, A. stepheni (Nicholls & Barnes, 1926) and A. pedisetosa Taiti & Humphreys, 2001, from Western Australia are also transferred to Haloniscus.

Tools to understand seasonality in health: quantification of microbe loads and analyses of compositional ecoimmunological data reveal complex patterns in Mojave Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) populations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Gopherus agassizii; Mojave Desert Tortoise; ecoimmunology; ectotherm; temporal variation	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY-TRACT DISEASE; FREE-RANGING DESERT; PASTEURELLA-TESTUDINIS; MYCOPLASMA-AGASSIZII; B-CELLS; SP-NOV; VERTEBRATES; BACTERIA; IMMUNITY	Using data from six wild Mojave Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii (Cooper, 1861)) populations, we quantified seasonal differences in immune system measurements and microbial load in the respiratory tract, pertinent to this species' susceptibility to upper respiratory tract disease. We quantified bacteria-killing activity of blood plasma and differential leukocyte counts to detect trends in temporal variation in immune function. We used centered log-ratio (clr) transformations of leukocyte counts and stress that such transformations are necessary for compositional data. We tested animals for the potential pathogen Pasteurella testudinis Snipes and Biberstein, 1982 with a newly created quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, as well as for the known respiratory pathogens Mycoplasma agassizii Brown et al., 2001 and Mycoplasma testudineum Brown et al., 2004. We found very little disease and suggest that P. testudinis is a prevalent, commensal microbe in these Mojave Desert Tortoise populations, and its quantification may be a tool to study natural fluctuations in microbe levels in Mojave Desert Tortoise respiratory tracts. Our analyses showed that both the potential for inflammatory responses and microbe levels are highest in the spring for healthy Mojave Desert Tortoises, when lymphocyte levels are lowest. The genetic and statistical tools that we used are easily applicable to other wildlife systems and provide the necessary data to quantify species-wide trends in health and test hypotheses pertinent to host-microbe dynamics.

Metarhizium humberi was first collected in 2001 in the Central Brazilian state of Goias, later found to be a common fungus in soils in Brazil, and since then has also been isolated from coleopteran, hemipteran and lepidopteran insects in Brazil and Mexico. This new species, named in honor of Richard A. Humber, a well-known insect pathologist and taxonomist of entomopathogenic fungi, is characterized by a high insecticidal activity against different developmental stages of arthropod pests with importance in agriculture and vectors of diseases to human and animals.

In the present study, based on an integrative approach, we examine the genetic diversity within the genus and describe a new species, Matuxia tymbyra Rossi and Leal-Zanchet, sp. nov., representing a southern lineage of the genus. We employed one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and other nuclear (elongation factor 1a, EF-1a) markers to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the genus. Maximum-parsimony analysis in a segment of the COI gene of 676 nucleotides showed 79 (11.68%) nucleotide positions exhibiting autapomorphic characters that support the occurrence of three independent evolutionary molecular operational taxonomic units in the genus. Similar evaluation for the dataset of the EF-1a gene showed a much smaller number of autapomorphies. Bayesian inference, maximum-likelihood and delimitation approaches, based on evolutionary models, showed that M. tymbyra is the sister species of the type-species of the genus, Matuxia tuxaua. They should be considered sibling species, only distinguishable based on details regarding eye arrangement and prostatic vesicle. The existence of 15 and 23 molecular autapomorphies, as revealed by maximum-parsimony analysis in a segment of the COI gene for M. tymbyra and M. tuxaua, respectively, allowed us to propose a molecular diagnosis for the new species, which is essential in cases of sibling species. The new species seems to be endemic from areas of Araucaria Forest in southern Brazil; the record augments the known distribution of the genus to the south.

For a better understanding of the timing and pattern of millipede evolution, Burmese amber offers a unique window into the Cretaceous period, ca. 99 Ma. Here, we describe the first known fossil of the colobognathan order Platydesmida, the species Andrognathus burmiticus n. sp. based on 15 specimens from Cretaceous Burmese amber. We combine classical light-microscopy and modern micro-computer tomography (mu CT) with computer aided 3D-reconstructions. These non-invasive techniques allow us to describe the fossil millipedes as detailed as is general practice for extant species, and to grant the scientific community open access to the deposited "Cybertypes". Based on the combination of unique morphological characters such as surface structures, body type, the unique size and shape of tergite 5, the absence of a hypoproct at the anal segment, and detailed gonopod characteristics, the studied fossils can be placed in the family Andrognathidae and the extant genus Andrognathus, which nowadays is restricted to the eastern USA and Mexico with three extant species. Therefore, the minimum age of the genus Andrognathus is pushed to the Cenomanian, 99 Ma. It can be assumed that the genus was much more diverse and wider distributed in the past and migrated between Asia and America via one of the once existing land bridges. These unique fossils prove the unusual relictual distribution of Andrognathus and can serve as key-fossils for the dating of the diplopod phylogeny.

However, the rare occurrence of the species, only found in sandy intertidal habitats, and the poor preservation of the type material have hampered detailed studies of the genus over time. Now, sixty years after the original description of Cateria styx, we present an extensive morphological and functional study based on new material collected from its type locality in Macae, Brazil. We combine live observations with detailed scanning electron microscopy data, new light microscopy material, confocal laser scanning microscopy and three-dimensional rendering. These observations show that C. styx displays a complex array of cuticular structures (spines, spinoscalids and extraordinarily complex cuticular ornamentation) that we interpret to be adaptations for mechanical adhesion, through friction and interlocking, in an interstitial habitat; the enigmatic dorsal organ, is a hydrostatic structure which function is inferred to be adhesive. Additional morphological traits in C. styx include: extremely elongated primary spinoscalids that cannot be completely retracted in the trunk; a reduced number of spinoscalids; sixteen elongated hairy patches in the introvert; fifteen trichoscalids that vary in length; the absence of a neck; dorsal spines being alternatingly displaced to either left or right side paradorsal positions; and high intraspecific variation in the number and position of glandular openings in the trunk.

Diversity and community structure of kinorhynchs around Svalbard: First insights into spatial patterns and environmental drivers	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Scalidophora Workshop	JAN 28-FEB 01, 2019	Fed Univ Parana, Ctr Marine Studies, Parana, BRAZIL		Fed Univ Parana, Ctr Marine Studies	Meiofauna; Spatial distribution; Community structure; Arctic	ECHINODERES KINORHYNCHA; DEEP-SEA; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; NEMATODE ASSEMBLAGES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; MARINE MEIOFAUNA; ARCTIC BENTHOS; SANDY BEACHES; NORTH-SEA; SP N.	Kinorhyncha is usually one of the more neglected groups in meiofauna ecology. Although their presence is frequently reported in a number of ecological meiofaunal studies, knowledge on their taxonomic composition and distribution at the local and regional scale is very limited. Particularly for the Arctic region, no comprehensive ecological description of kinorhynch communities has yet existed. To address this gap in our knowledge, we compared kinorhynch community structure in different localities: in the region north of Svalbard, in the Barents Sea and four Spitsbergen fjords. Sample locations covered a wide depth gradient from 300 up to 2200 m and different environmental regimes. We analyzed over 4000 individuals among which 18 species belonging to 4 genera and 2 families were identified. The most common species were Echinoderes drogoni and Echinoderes angustus, while the most dominant species was Echinoderes eximus. Patterns of species abundance and shift in their occurrence across the stations were pronounced, with notable distinctions between regions. Three distinct kinorhynch assemblages were observed: 'fjord assemblage' dominated by E. eximus and characterized by the highest standing stock and diversity; 'open water assemblage' with Echinoderes arlis as dominant species and 'north of Svalbard assemblage' characterized by the presence of E. drogoni and Echinoderes peterseni, but at the same time, by the lowest abundance and diversity. We found sediment particle size diversity as the most important explanatory variable. Variation in kinorhynch community structures and diversity was also explained by water depth, but this factor was less important in comparison to sediment characteristics. Surprisingly, food-related variables did not contribute significantly to the model, which could suggest that food partitioning did not influence on promoting diversity. However, it is the first study of arctic kinorhynch ecology and further research is needed to get a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental drivers for turnover in Arctic kinorhynch diversity and distribution.

Of these, Echinoderes kaempfae sp. nov. and Echinoderes schwieringae sp. nov. are described as new species. Echinoderes multiporus originally found on Eratosthenes Seamount, Mediterranean Sea, and Echinoderes cf. adrianovi originally found off Florida, northwestern Atlantic Ocean, were also recovered. In addition, three additional species, which possibly represent undescribed species, occurred on Senghor Seamount. Because of the low number of available specimens or necessity of further observations of closely related congeners for these three undescribed species, we provide only a brief description of them without naming them as new species. The comparison of each species with morphologically similar congeners is also provided. Based on all records of kinorhynchs from seamounts and the adjacent deep-sea floor in the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Arctic Sea, it is suggested that (1) the kinorhynch fauna on seamounts is partly unique, (2) seamount kinorhynchs originate both from shallow waters and the deep sea, and (3) a few kinorhynch species diversified on seamounts.

This study is the first in a series focused on kinorhynchs mainly collected at the German zone following requirements of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), who demands identification of fauna associated with nodules previous to the concession of the exploitation license. A total of 18 species were found, of which three new Echinoderidae species are described herein. Cephalorhyncha polunga sp. nov. is easily discriminated from its congeners by the presence of pointed and prominent tergal extensions together with middorsal spines on segments 4-8, ventrolateral tubes on segment 2, lateroventral tubes on segment 5, lateroventral spines on segments 6-9 and midlateral tubes on segment 10; plus subdorsal type 2 glandular cell outlets on segment 2 and midlateral ones on segment 8. Echinoderes shenlong sp. nov. is characterized by middorsal spines on segments 4, 6, 8, lateroventral tubes on segment 5 and lateroventral spines on segments 6-9; glandular cell outlets type 2 are not present. Meristoderes taro sp. nov. is defined by the combination of long middorsal spines on segments 4-8, remarkably increasing in length on posterior segments; short laterodorsal tubes on segment 10, ventrolateral tubes on segment 2 and lateroventral tubes on segment 5, plus lateroventral spines on segments 6-9.

SP-NOV; GEN.	A new species of Kinorhyncha, Triodontoderes lagahoo sp. nov., is described from Tobago Island, Caribbean Sea (western Atlantic Ocean) from a coastal, sandy habitat using both light and scanning electron microscopy. The species is characterized by the presence of middorsal acicular spines on segments 1-11 (that on segment 10 crenulated in males), laterodorsal crenulated spines on segment 10 only in males, lateroventral acicular spines on segments 3-4 and 6-8 (lateroventral spines also on segment 10 in females), lateroventral cuspidate spines on segments 5 and 9, lateral accessory acicular spines on segments 5 and 9, lateral accessory cuspidate spines on segment 8, ventrolateral acicular spines on segment 2 and ventrolateral cuspidate spines on segment 2. Females furthermore possess short papillae in ventrolateral position on segment 8 and ventromedial position on segment 9. The absence of cuspidate spines in lateral accessory position on segment 6 easily distinguishes T. lagahoo sp. nov. from the single known congener, Triodontoderes anulap. Moreover, also the arrangement of female papillae and sensory spots differ between the species. The finding of a new species of Triodontoderes in the Caribbean Sea is the first report of the genus for American waters and the Atlantic Ocean since its original description. Additionally, a dichotomous key for identification of the family Zelinkaderidae to species level, as well as systematic remarks on some morphological characters of the new species are included herein.

P. Higgins' unexamined Caribbean meiofaunal samples, which have been stored in the Smithsonian Institution collections. The species from Puerto Rico, Cristaphyes cornifrons sp. nov., belongs to the class Allomalorhagida, whereas the species from Barbados, Echinoderes barbadensis sp. nov., belongs to the class Cyclorhagida. C. cornifrons sp. nov. is easily distinguished from most of its congeners by the presence of lateral terminal spines and the absence of male, sexually dimorphic, ventromedial tubes on segment 2, as only other two species of the genus lack these features. Of these, C. cornifrons sp. nov. may be easily differentiated by its pattern of paradorsal, ventrolateral and ventromedial setae. E. barbadensis sp. nov. is unique among its congeners by the combined presence of middorsal spines on segments 4-8, lateroventral spines on segments 6-9, lateral accessory tubes on segment 8, lateroventral tubes on segment 5, ventrolateral tubes on segment 2 and type 2 glandular cell outlets in subdorsal position on segment 2 and in midlateral position on segment 4.

Four new species of kinorhynchs, Cristaphyes fortis sp. nov., Higginsium mazatlanensis sp. nov., Cephalorhyncha teresae sp. nov. and Echinoderes xalkutaat sp. nov., are described herein. C. fortis sp. nov. may be distinguished from its most similar congeners by its more strongly developed pachycycli and ball-and-socket joints and the presence of unpaired paradorsal setae on segments 2, 4 and 6, two pairs of ventrolateral setae on segment 5, one pair of ventrolateral setae on segments 2-4, 6-7 and 10, and one pair of ventromedial setae on segments 8-9. H. mazatlanensis sp. nov. is easily distinguished from its congeners by the combined presence of subdorsal setae only on segment 1 and lateroventral setae only on even segments. C. teresae sp. nov. is unique within the genus by the presence of acicular spines in middorsal position on segments 4, 6 and 8, in sublateral position on segment 7 and in lateroventral position on segments 8 and 9, as well as tubes in subdorsal position on segment 2, and in lateroventral position on segment 5. Moreover, this species has primary pectinate fringes of segments 2-7 bearing a tuft of elongated spinous projections in middorsal position, which is unique among its congeners. E. xalkutaat sp. nov. belongs to a group of Echinoderes characterized by possessing type 2 glandular cell outlets in subdorsal, laterodorsal, sublateral and ventrolateral positions on segment 2, together with middorsal spines on segments 4-8, lateroventral spines on segments 6-9 and lateroventral tubes on segment 5, but the arrangement of the remaining type 2 glandular cell outlets (in midlateral position on segment 5, in sublateral position on segment 8 and in laterodorsal position on segment 10) and the cuticular composition of segment 11 (one tergal and two sternal plates) allow its morphological differentiation.

In contrast to the many described lineages of cave exclusive crustaceans and annelids, very little is known about cave scalidophorans. We here describe two new species of kinorhynchs from a lava tube in the Canary Islands and a cenote in the Yucatan Peninsula. Leiocanthus bretti sp. nov., from Tenerife, is mainly characterized by the lack of middorsal structure specializations on all trunk segment, middorsal line covered by hairs on segments 3-9, unpaired paradorsal setae on segments 2-9, middorsal seta on segment 10, and laterodorsal setae on segments 2-9 and 11. Pycnophyes kukulkan sp. nov. from Yucatan is defined by the strong denticulation in the tergal anterior margin, as a barbed comb, followed by the autapomorphic presence a pool of depressed and perforated cuticular annuli on the anterior half of the plate. The species is also defined by the combination of the following features: very long lateral terminal spines (LTS/TL above 38%), middorsal elevations on segments 2-9, unpaired paradorsal setae on segments 4, 6, 8, paired laterodorsal setae on segments 2-9, lateroventral setae on segments 2, 4, 6-8, 10 (two pairs on segment 10), ventrolateral setae on segment 5 plus ventrolateral or ventromedial setae on segments 3-8, and ventromedial ones on segment 9. The new species are discussed in reference to the diversity of cave scalidophorans, including possible adaptations to the ecological conditions found in some caves. A checklist with all the records of scalidophorans in caves is provided. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The genus and species is characterized by a cylindrical neck with sparsely arranged longitudinal crimps at surface; segments 1-10 each consisting of a single cylindrical cuticular plate; middorsal and ventromedial string-like glandular cells on segments 1-9; primary pectinate fringes with pectinate fringe teeth on segments 1-10; lateral accessory pores on segments 2-10; unpaired dorsal spines on segments 3-11 or 4-11, of which those on segments 3-9 are alternatingly laterally displaced left or right to paradorsal positions, and those on segments 10 and 11 in middorsal position; lateral accessory acicular spines on segment 5; lateroventral acicular spines on segments 4, 6-10; and tubes in lateroventral position on segments 2 and 5 and in ventrolateral position on segment 1. Together with the description of G. mawatarii gen. et sp. nov., emended diagnoses for the family Franciscideridae and the genus Franciscideres are provided. The introvert morphology of G. mawatarii gen. et sp. nov. is unique within Kinorhyncha, but showing some similarities to those of Franciscideres and Cateria, suggesting a close relationship between these three genera. The thin and flexible trunk cuticle in G. mawatarii gen. et sp. nov., Franciscideres, Neocentrophyidae, and some kentrorhagids would be related to the adaptation of interstitial environment. The thickening or thinning of cuticle has evolved independently at least twice in the kinorhynch lineages. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The specimens were collected in the Gulf of Castellammare (Tyrrhenian Sea, Sicily, Southern Italy) and off Livorno (Ligurian Sea, Tuscany, Central Italy), respectively. The new taxa represent the first species of Condyloderes described from the Mediterranean basin. Condyloderes agnetis sp. nov. is distinguished from its congeners by bearing cuspidate spines on segment 3 - a character never reported before for Cyclorhagida - in subdorsal position, paradorsally and sublaterally on segment 7, an extremely short midterminal spine, and a combination of cuspidate spines in lateral accessory position on segments 2 and 9, ventrolaterally slightly displaced ventromedially on segment 5, and ventrolaterally on segment 8. Condyloderes clarae sp. nov. is characterized by a combination of cuspidate spines on segments 5, 8, and 9 only, cuspidate spines ventrolaterally on segment 8 and in a lateral accessory position on segment 9, ventromedial appendages on segments 5, 6, and 7 in females. Both species exhibit the recently described type-6 sensory spots. Furthermore, the female morphology and data on the distribution of Condyloderes multispinosus (McIntyre, 1962) within the Mediterranean Sea are reported, along with the record of the co-occurrence of different species of Condyloderes at the same site. We report a certain degree of intraspecific variation of taxonomically diagnostic characters like the presence or absence of cuspidate spines and sensory spots on some segments in C. agnetis sp. nov. and C. multispinosus. The presence of regularly arranged cuticular hairs on most trunk segments and of an acicular spine in lateral accessory position on segment 1, along with the absence of an area of micropapillae on segment 9 in females of C. agnetis sp. nov. and C. clarae sp. nov., unique within the genus, suggest the existence of distinct evolutionary lines within Condyloderes. The discovery of the two new species highlights the potential species richness of a genus considered species-poor until recently. Our findings underscore the importance of promoting further studies even in rather well investigated areas, such as the Mediterranean basin. Beyond the taxonomic and biogeographical interest, the data reported herein provides additional insights for ongoing taxonomic and phylogenetic investigations on the Centroderidae and allies, and on the whole Cyclorhagida.

Additional species are furthermore reported from the two regions, including Condyloderes kurilensis from the Californian deep-sea, one potentially new species from each of the two regions, and the presence of specimens similar to, and potentially conspecific with, the two new species, i.e., Condyloderes cf. C. rohalorum sp. nov. in the Gulf of Mexico, and Condyloderes cf. C. flosfimbriatus sp. nov. from the Californian deep-sea. Examinations of C. rohalorum sp. nov. reveal that the species has two different adult female stages, hence representing the first example of adult female dimorphism known from this genus, and indicating that adult moulting might happen amongst species of Condyloderes.

A new root-knot nematode, parasitizing Robusta coffee in Dak Lak Province, Western Highlands of Vietnam, is described as Meloidogyne moensi n. sp. Morphological and molecular analyses demonstrated that this species differs clearly from other previously described root-knot nematodes. Morphologically, the new species is characterized by a swollen body of females with a small posterior protuberance that elongated from ovoid to saccate; perineal patterns with smooth striae, continuous and low dorsal arch; lateral lines marked as a faint space or linear depression at junction of the dorsal and ventral striate; distinct phasmids; perivulval region free of striae; visible and wide tail terminus surrounding by concentric circles of striae; medial lips of females in dumbbell-shaped and slightly raised above lateral lips; female stylet is normally straight with posteriorly sloping stylet knobs; lip region of second stage juvenile (J2) is not annulated; medial lips and labial disc of J2 formed dumbbell shape; lateral lips are large and triangular; tail of J2 is conoid with rounded unstriated tail tip; distinct phasmids and hyaline; dilated rectum. Meloidogyne moensi n. sp. is most similar to M. africana, M. ottersoni by prominent posterior protuberance. Results of molecular analysis of rDNA sequences including the D2-D3 expansion regions of 28S rDNA, COI, and partial COII/16S rRNA of mitochondrial DNA support for the new species status.	[Le, T. M.

Description of a new species of rhinebothriidean tapeworm from the skate Dipturus batis in the Mediterranean Sea	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article						Algerian coast; biodiversity; Cestoda; Dipturus batis; Echeneibothrium algeriensis n; sp; Echeneibothrium; Mediterranean Sea; Rajiformes; Rhinebothriidea; tapeworms	ECHENEIBOTHRIUM CESTODA-TETRAPHYLLIDEA; HOST-SPECIFICITY; FEEDING-HABITS; RAJID SKATES; BENEDEN 1849; DIET; PHYLLOBOTHRIIDAE; PLATYHELMINTHES; ELASMOBRANCHS; PART	Examination of rajid skates off the Algerian coast in the Mediterranean Sea revealed that three of the 33 Dipturus batis Linnaeus, 1758 examined harboured a new tapeworm species: Echeneibothrium algeriensis n. sp. This new species, collected from the anterior half of the spiral valves, is described on the basis of morphological data from light and scanning electron microscopy. The new species differs from previously described Echeneibothrium species by details of the scolex and loculi, total length, the length of the myzorhynchus, the number of proglottides, and the number of testes. Comparison of the diets of the ten skate species common in the Mediterranean basin indicates some varying degree of overlap, suggesting that host specificity in this host-parasite system is determined by other host and/or ecological variables such as adaptations of the parasites to their respective hosts, either on the morpho-anatomical level, in physiological characteristics of the parasite's habitat, in the trophic requirements for the successful transmission of the parasite, or in adaptations to the behavioural characteristics of the host. Furthermore, restricted overlap of E. algeriensis n. sp. with congeners in parasite assemblages of D. batis indicates some structuring according to attachment-site preferences. However, attachment-site preferences are not explained solely by morphological compatibility between bothridia and villi. This study reiterates the need to examine multiple factors synergistically in studies on host specificity of parasites, and the need to examine the parasite fauna of hosts across their entire geographical range in order to truly appreciate the biodiversity they harbour.

This group was the only vertebrate representative until the Devonian but now comprises almost half of the vertebrate species, dominating nearly all aquatic environments. The fossil record is the key to understand the ancient paleobiodiversity and the patterns that lead the modern fish fauna, and paleontological collections play a fundamental role in providing accommodation, maintenance, and access to the specimens and their respective metadata. Here we present a systematic checklist of fossil fishes housed in the type collection of the Coleccion Nacional de Paleontologia which is located at the Instituto de Geologia of Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Currently housed in the type collection are 14 chondrichthyan specimens, belonging to two superorders, five orders, seven families, 10 genera, and five nominal species, and 361 osteichthyan specimens, belonging to eight orders, nine families, nine genera, and 26 nominal species. These fossils come from 32 localities and 15 geological units, which range temporally from the Jurassic to the Pleistocene. The paleoichthyofauna housed in the type collection of the Coleccion Nacional de Paleontologia is remarkable for its singularity and reveals new insights about the origin and diversification of many groups of fishes. The recovery and curation of this fossil material indicates that knowledge of Mexican fossil fish diversity and its role in understanding lower vertebrate evolution are just emerging and reaffirms the importance of the biological and paleontological collections to the future biodiversity research.

These animals arrived in North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. During the Quaternary, at least three genera existed: Tonnicinctus Geis, Gonzalez Ruiz, Scillato-Yand and Soibelzon, Pampatherium Gervais and Ameghino, and Holmesina Simpson. They are differentiated mainly by craniodental and osteodermal characters. In this paper, we describe a new species of Holmesina from Bahia state, Brazil. Two well-preserved specimens possessing osteoderms associated with their skeletons enabled us to determine the genus and species more reliably. Holmesina cryptae sp. nov. differs from the other Quaternary pampatheres by having the simplest ornamental pattern of osteoderms, sharing characteristics between Pampatherium and Holmesina osteoderms and the most robust skull among the Holmesina species, however preserving the main synapomorphies of the genus. Moreover, the integrity of the remains of H. cryptae sp. nov. enabled us to describe elements of the hyoid apparatus, the clavicle, the entire vertebral column and the pelvis. It was also possible to mast= its total axial length (2.2 m) more reliably, which is smaller than previously estimated for other pampatheres. Holmesina cryptae sp. nov. constitutes the sixth species of the genus, and it is the fourth in South America.

This genus accommodates a lot of species, but only three have been known from Japanese waters. In this study, we report Edwardsia aff. tuberculata Duben and Koren, 1847 and describe a new species E. alternobomen sp. nov. from seas around Japan. Both are characterized by prominent, papillae-like nemathybomes which contain unusually large nematocysts. Some nematocysts of E. alternobomen sp. nov. are over 200 mu m in length, which are the largest reported for a member of Edwardsiidae.

Review of the fossil record of Bittacomorphinae (Diptera: Ptychopteridae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						fossil insect; new species; Zhiganka; Early Cretaceous	INSECTA DIPTERA; HISTORY; GENUS	The fossil record of Bittacomorphinae is poor. The two extant bittacomorphine genera are unknown as fossils and only two extinct genera, each with two species, have been described earlier: Zhiganka Lukashevich, 1995 from the Mesozoic of Eurasia and Probittacomorpha Freiwald et Willmann, 1992 from the Cenozoic of Europe. Both previously known species of Zhiganka have each been described based on a single isolated wing. A discovery of well preserved complete males and females of Zhiganka longialata sp. nov. from Khasurty (Western Transbaikalia, Russia) makes the diagnosis of Bittacomorphinae more vague, but does not contradict the bittacomorphine affinity of Zhiganka and confirms the Early Cretaceous age of the subfamily.

Female specimens of two unknown species of this genus were collected from abyssal sediments during an expedition to the northwestern Pacific on board research vessel ISABU (Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology) in November 2017. In this paper we describe the females of two new species, L. senaria sp. nov. and L. apousia sp. nov. The new species were attributed to the genus Leptotachidia by the combination of the five-segmented female antennule, presence of the Brodskaya organ on the distal antennulary segment, and the second exopodal segments of second to fourth legs without inner setae. An outstanding character of both Pacific species is the reduced armature of thoracic legs in contrast to the type species, L. iberica Becker, 1974. In addition, the seta! armature of L. senaria sp. nov. and L. apousia sp. nov. is unique within the genus in that the female leg 5 of L. senaria sp. nov. has six elements instead of five; and the antennary exopod of L. apousia sp. nov. bears a single seta on the proximal segment instead of two. This is the first record of Leptotachidia from the Pacific. A key to all three species of Leptotachidia is provided.

Ctenophorus spinodomus sp. nov., a New Species of Dragon Lizard (Squamata: Agamidae) from Triodia Mallee Habitat of Southeast Australia	RECORDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM			English	Article						Agamidae; dragon lizard; Ctenophorus; Triodia Mallee; taxonomy; new species; Eastern Mallee Dragon	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; SKINKS; DIVERGENCE; DYNAMICS	Research into geographic variation in the agamid lizard Ctenophorus fordi supports a pattern of regional lineage diversity identified in earlier genetic studies, and provides new information on differences in morphology diagnostic of these lineages. One of the most genetically divergent and morphologically distinctive of these lineages is that consisting of populations from Triodia Mallee habitat of the red sandplains of inland southeast Australia. Populations from this region are the sister lineage to all other "C. fordi", a suite of four genetically regionally discrete lineages distributed across the arid inland of southern Australia. They can be distinguished by a unique black "T" shaped chest pattern in adult males which, in combination with certain features of body proportions and scalation. diagnose the lineage from all other "C. fordi". On the strength of these differences we describe populations belonging to this lineage as a new species, Ctenophorus spinodontus sp. nov. This new species is highly restricted in the habitat it occupies, and its ecology tied to a reliance on the presence of Triodia hummock grass groundcover (spinifex) for shelter, foraging and social interactions. It appears to be most abundant in areas of extensive and healthy Triodia that develop 20-50 years post-burn, and as a consequence too many or too few fires can both have negative impacts on the suitability of hummock grass groundcover for this species. Mallee habitat in southeast Australia is fragmented. and large fires in the smaller isolated areas of habitat could result in loss of suitable habitat for the species, resulting in localized extinction with no opportunity for recruitment. These factors in combination with ongoing loss of habitat place the remaining populations of C. spinodomus sp. nov. at a high level of vulnerability.

The first species is most similar to O. inya (Weiner & Kapms', 2014) known from the Altai Mountains, and can be distinguished from the latter by larger body size and the number of ventral psx (00/000/121101(m) in O. wanglangensis sp. nov. vs 1/000/212101(m) in O. inya). The other two species, together with O. montana Weiner, 1994, O. pseudomontana Sun & Wu, 2012 and O. chankaensis Sun & Wu, 2012, form a distinct species-group characterized by the presence of 4+4 pso on antennal base and full-sized anal spines. Both these new species differ from the known congeners of this group by having only 2+2 posterior pso on the head. O. ussurica sp. nov. and O. kedroviensis sp. nov. can be separated due to different number of abdominal pso, i.e. 5(6)5554 in the former vs 44454 in the latter species.

Coryphophthalmus obscurus sp. nov. and C. serbicus sp. nov., in the subgenus Verhoeffius subgen. nov., are described from Serbia. Coryphophthalmus obscurus sp. nov. differs from other species of this subgenus in the relatively short body and antennae, elongated compound eyes, tarsus with numerous spine-like setae and ovipositor with more divisions than other species. Coryphophthalmus serbicus sp. nov. is most similar to C. longitarsus (Kaplin) from Abkhazia. The main differences between these species consist in the line of eye contact, structure of the paired ocelli, labial palps, legs, urocoxites IX, ovipositor and male parameres.

A characteristic trait of the new genus is the occurrence of the intestinal diverticula in segments IX-X. The main morphological features of the new genus are: 4-5(6) straight chaetae per bundle, origin of dorsal vessel in clitellar region, anteseptale of nephridia consisting of funnel only. coelomocytes only mucocytes, oesophageal appendages absent, spermathecae united proximally and connected jointly with the oesophagus. Decimodrilus diverticulatus sp. n. has spermathecae with two diverticula-like protrusions and two globular sperm masses. D. globulatus sp. n. has spermathecae with two or three sperm rolls. Molecular taxonomic analysis based on a concatenated phylogenetic tree supports the status of the new genus and that of the two new species.

Mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (28S rDNA) fragments as well as several morphological traits were used to characterize Niphargus urmiensis sp. nov. and Niphargus fiseri sp. nov. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the nucleotide differences between the recently described species and their close allies are attributed to their distinctiveness. The molecular analysis also introduced that the new species are placed within the Glade comprising Iranian species as a sister taxon. The genetic distances between N. urmiensis sp. nov. and N. fiseri sp. nov. are 7.6% and 1.6%, respectively based on the COI and 28S rDNA gene fragments.

The discovery of Rock Geckos Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 (Squamata: Gekkonidae) in the Tanintharyi Region, Myanmar with the description of two new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Taxonomy; lizards; Southeast Asia; biodiversity; Reptilia; morphology	HEMIPHYLLODACTYLUS BLEEKER; CROCODILE NEWT; SRI-LANKA; REPTILIA; PHYLOGENY; SERPENTES; SUMATRA; SALAMANDRIDAE; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SPECIATION	We report the first occurrence of the Asian Rock Gecko genus Cnemaspis Strauch, 1887 from mainland Myanmar based on a series of specimens recently collected from the Tanintharyi Region. These records come from several localities in the Tanintharyi Region and fill a significant sampling gap for the genus. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using the mitochondrial gene ND2 identify two distinct Glades, the first includes Cnemaspis siamensis of the Southeast Asian Cnemaspis group and the second includes two new species belonging to the South Asian Cnemaspis kandiana group. These two species are morphologically distinct and are distinguished from all other members in the C. kandiana group by a combination of character states. The first species, Cnemaspis tanintharyi sp. nov. occurs on the mainland in southern Tanintharyi and is distinguished from all congeners by the possession of keeled pectoral scales; smooth ventral scales and abdominal scales; 2-4 precloacal pores; 4-5 femoral pores on each leg; smooth subcaudal scales with the median row enlarged; coloration of the gular region beige, dark gray -brown with dark blue hueing towards throat; 15-18 subdigital lamellae on the 4th toe; and 21-23 ventral scales at midbody. The other, Cnemaspis thayawthadangyi sp. nov. is known only from the island group of Thayawthadangyi, in the Myeik Archipelago and is distinguished from all congeners by the possession of keeled pectoral scales; keeled ventral scales and abdominal scales; three precloacal pores; four femoral pores on each leg; smooth subcaudal scales, scales on median mw enlarged; coloration of the gular region silver with dark-gray irregularly shaped streaks; 16-18 subdigital lamellae on the 4th toe; and 18-20 ventral scales at midbody. In addition, we address the taxonomic status of populations referred to as C. kandiana (a species now restricted to Sri Lanka) found in peninsular Thailand and provisionally assign them as C. cf. tanintharyi sp. nov. until further analysis can be conducted. Finally, we briefly discuss the biogeography of the South Asian Glade of Cnemaspis.

(Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Triozidae), a new species of jumping plant-louse inducing galls on the leaves of Pouteria ramiflora (Mart.) Radlk. (Sapotaceae): taxonomy, gall structure and histochemistry	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Galling insect; galls; biology; leaf galls	APOPLASTIC OXIDATIVE BURST; AUXIN TRANSPORT; PROTEIN-CONTENT; TISSUES; ROLES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CECIDOMYIIDAE; MORPHOGENESIS; INVERTASES; MECHANISMS	Ceropsylla pouteriae Burckhardt sp. nov. is described and illustrated from Brazil: Minas Gerais. It induces pit galls on the leaves of Pouteria ramiflora (Mart.) Radlk. (Sapotaceae), a characteristic tree of the Cerrado biome. The previously artificial genus Ceropsylla is redefined and six species are transferred from Ceropsylla to Trioza as Trioza angustirerta (Li, 2011), comb. nov., Trioza celticola (Li, 2011), comb. nov., Trioza cestolemba (Li, 2011), comb. nov., Trioza discrepans (Tuthill, 1945), comb. nov., Trioza martorelli (Caldwell, 1942), comb. nov. and Trioza pulchra (Tuthill, 1945), comb. nov. The psyllids on Sapotaceae are reviewed and the phylogenetic relationships of Ceropsylla briefly discussed. The Ceropsylla pouteriae gall develops from cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the mesophyll leaf tissue, as well as neoformation of vascular tissues. The hypertrophy of the palisade parenchyma cells leads to the formation of the adaxial cortex of the gall. The abaxial cortex originates from the spongy parenchyma. The elongation of the adaxial and abaxial cortex is responsible for the intralaminar gall shape. The neoformation of vascular bundles is an important feature for the phloem feeding Ceropsylla pouteriae. The intralaminar morphotype of the C. pouteriae gall showed a simple anatomical structure. It lacks defence-related compounds and nutritive tissue. The structural simplicity contrasts with the presence of chemical substances in the gall tissue.

New Oligoneuriidae (Insecta, Ephemeroptera) from Iran	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Barcoding; mayflies; Middle East; Oligoneuriella; Oligoneuriopsis; taxonomy; new species	COALESCENT	Two new species of the mayfly family Oligoneuriidae are described based on larval specimens recently collected in Iran. The first new species, Oligoneuriella tuberculata Godunko & Staniczek, sp. nov., can be distinguished from all its congeners by the presence of pronounced protuberances posteromedially on abdominal terga, highly reduced paracercus, large lamella of gill I, and setation on hind margin of middle and hind femora confined to their basal halves. The second species, Oligoneuriopsis villosus Bojkova, Godunko, & Staniczek, sp. nov., remarkably belongs to a mostly Afrotropical genus. The new species clearly differs from all its congeners in the shape of setae on the surface of gills and terga, pattern of body colouration, and the shape of posterolateral projections of abdominal segments. Except for the species description, the generic diagnosis of Oligoneuriopsis Crass, 1947 is briefly discussed. COI barcode sequences of both new species are provided and molecular species delimitation is tested using distance-based and likelihood-based approaches, with both new species unambiguously recognised as separate lineages. The analysis of COI also corroborates the respective affinities of both new species, estimated based on morphology. The two new species of Oligoneuriidae described herein highlight the importance of the Middle East as a centre of diversity of this mayfly family within the Palaearctic.

It is located on the northwestern edge of the Coral Triangle, the region with the highest marine biodiversity. Much of the marine fauna here is still unknown, especially inconspicuous animals, such as small stoloniferous octocorals, which are common on coral reefs. Here, we describe two new monospecific genera of the family Arulidae found off the coast of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, East Malaysia; Bunga payung gen. nov. et sp. nov. and Laeta waheedae gen. nov. et sp. nov. As well, the stoloniferan genus Phenganax Alderslade & McFadden, 2011 belonging to the family Clavulariidae is expanded with three new species, P. marumi sp. nov., P. subtilis sp. nov., and P. stokvisi sp. nov., which are all sclerite-free. Additionally, we report a possibly undescribed species, closely related to the clavulariid genera Azoriella Lopez-Gonzalez & Gili, 2001 and Cervera Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 1995. As this and other recent studies have shown, discoveries of small stoloniferous octocorals are helping to fill gaps in our knowledge of the overall systematics of Octocorallia.

We examined more than 385 specimens and evaluated new and previously used qualitative and quantitative morphological characters. We redescribe the Colombian species and present morphological characters for both sexes and an emended diagnosis for the subgenus Tityus (Archaeotityus). We describe a new species Tityus guane sp. nov. from Santander department, Colombia, Tityus betschi Lourenco 1992 is synonymized with Tityus parvulus Kraepelin, 1914, and Tityus wayuu Rojas-Runjaic & Armas, 2007 is synonymized with Tityus tayrona Lourenco, 1991. We measured 186 specimens and performed a multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) for 34 selected morphometric ratios for each sex. We found that a few morphological ratios support species level distinctions within the Colombian species. We provide updated distributional maps with new records and an identification key for both sexes. Furthermore, we provide an updated checklist for the subgenus and a discussion about the character systems used within Tityus (Archaeotityus). The new morphological characters proposed and the traditional morphometry examined with a PCA are useful for studying Tityus (Archaeotityus) taxonomy.

J	Whitworth, TL; Yusseff-Vanegas, S				Whitworth, Terry L.; Yusseff-Vanegas, Sohath			A revision of the genera and species of the Neotropical family Mesembrinellidae (Diptera: Oestroidea)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Calliphora; COIbarcodes; corrigendum; Laneella; Laneellinae; lectotypes; Mesembrinella; Mesembrinellinae; new synonyms; new species; Souzalopesiella; Souzalopesiellinae; taxonomic keys; type species	ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY; BLOW FLIES; CALLIPHORIDAE; DNA; BARCODE; PHYLOGENETICS; IDENTIFY; COLOMBIA; MODEL	The Neotropical family Mesembrinellidae is revised. A total of 53 valid, extant species are included in the family, including 15 described as new and 38 redescribed based on study of type and non-type material and of the literature. A total of 18 primary types were examined. An additional ca. 2300 specimens, belonging to 47 species, were studied in detail, including dissection and photographic documentation of terminalia, with many females illustrated for the first time. Keys to subfamilies, genera, species-groups and species are provided. Type specimens of six species housed in South American institutions could not be obtained for study, i.e., M. bequaerti Seguy, 1925 and the five recently described species M. andina (Wolff et al., 2014), M. carvalhoi (Wolff et al., 2013b), M. cordillera (Wolff & Ramos-Pastrana in Wolff et al., 2017), M. obscura (Wolff in Wolff et al., 2017) and Laneella patriciae (Wolff, 2013). We accept the synonymy, proposed by previous authors, of Eumesembrinella Townsend. 1931 with Mesembrinella Giglio-Tos, 1893. In addition, we synonymize the genera Albuquerquea Mello, 1967, Giovanella Bonatto in Bonatto & Marinoni, 2005, Henriquella Bonatto in Bonatto & Marinoni, 2005, Huascaromusca Townsend, 1918 and Thompsoniella Guimaraes, 1977 with Mesembrinella Giglio-Tos, 1893, synn. nov., retaining three valid genera in the family: Laneella Mello, 1967, Mesembrinella and Souzalopesiella Guimaraes, 1977. Laneella nigripes Guimarks, 1977 and Mesembrinella bellardiana Aldrich, 1922 are fixed as the type species of the genera Laneella Mello, 1967 and Mesembrinella Giglio-Tos, 1893, respectively, under Article 70.3 of the ICZN Code. We separate Mesembrinella into the following species-groups: Al latifrons (Mello, 1967), Al spicata Aldrich, 1925, M. bolivar (Bonatto in Bonatto & Marinoni, 2005), Al. aeneiventris (Wiedemann, 1830), Al. bicolor (Fabricius, 1805), and M anomala (Guimaraes, 1977). The following 15 new species are described: Laneella fusconitida Whitworth sp. nov. from Costa Rica,. Ecuador and Venezuela, Laneella fuscosquamata Whitworth, sp. nov. from Guatemala and Mexico, Laneella purpurea Whitworth. sp. nov. from Costa Rica, Mesembrinella bullata Whitworth, sp. nov. from Bolivia, .Mesembrinella chantrvi Whitworth, sp. nov. from French Guiana and Brazil, Mesembrinella epandrioaurantia Whitworth, sp. nov. from Venezuela, Mesembrinella guaramacalensis Whitworth. sp. nov. from Venezuela, Mesembrinella longicercus Whitworth, sp. nov. from Bolivia, Mesembrinella mexicana Whitworth, sp. nov. from Mexico, Mesembrinella nigrocoerulea Whitworth, sp. nov. from Costa Rica, Ecuador and Venezuela, Mesembrinella serrata Whitworth, sp. nov. from Peru. Mesembrinella velasquezae Whitworth, sp. nov. from Venezuela, Mesembrinella violacea Whitworth, sp. nov. from Costa Rica, Mesembrinella woodorum Whitworth, sp. nov. from Ecuador, and Mesembrinella zurquiensis Whitworth, sp. nov. from Costa Rica. Mesembrinella abaca Hall, 1948 is proposed as a junior synonym of Mesembrinella socors (Walker, 1861), syn. nov. Lectotypes are designated for Dexia randa Walker, 1849 (now M esembrinella) and Mesembrinella pictipennis Aldrich, 1922. We analyze the most extensive DNA-barcode dataset for Mesembrinellidae to date, encompassing the three genera considered valid and including 188 sequences (178 new) from 35 species, with data for 23 species provided for the first time. The topology of the resulting Neighbor-Joining tree is mostly congruent with morphology; however, some species show considerable genetic variation that is not reflected by morphology. Finally, we include a corrigendum to the recent Zootaxa paper on Nearctic Calliphora Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Calliphoridae) by Tantawi et al.

Nylanderia of the World Part III: Nylanderia in the West Indies	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						ant; Caribbean; Formicinae; genus-group; morphology; new species; taxonomy	PRENOLEPIS GENUS-GROUP; ANT GENUS; HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; PARATRECHINA; PHYLOGENY	The diversity of the formicine ant genus Nylanderia is currently underestimated and largely undescribed. This includes the faunas of tropical regions where species richness is typically high. Here, the taxonomy of the West Indian Nylanderia fauna is revised for the first time. Fourteen new species are described, bringing the total number of species known from the region to 22. The new species are: N. bibadia, sp. nov., N. caerula, sp. nov., N. coven, sp. nov., N. disatra, sp. nov., N. esperanza, sp. nov., N. fuscaspecula, sp. nov., N. lucayana, sp. nov., N. metacista, sp. nov., N. pini, sp. nov., N. semitincta, sp. nov., N. sierra, sp. nov., N. wardi, sp. nov., N. xestonota, sp. nov., and N. zaminyops, sp. nov. There are several introduced species in the region including the globally widespread Old World species N. bourbonica. Other introduced species are N. fulva, N. pubens, N. guatemalensis, and N. steinheili. The following new synonyms are proposed: fulva Mayr 1862 (= fulva cubana Santschi 1930); steinheili Forel 1893 (= steinheili minuta Forel 1893). An identification key is provided for the workers of Nylanderia found in the West Indies. Photomontage images are provided for the worker of each species and when available photomontage and SEM images are provided for males. This work represents another step forward in understanding the diversity of this widespread and commonly encountered ant genus.

Axianassa planioculus n. sp. is morphologically closest to A. mineri Boone, 1931, known from Pacific Panama, among the 11 known congeners, but is readily distinguished from the latter by the eyes being dorsally concealed by the rostrum, the subovate telson, the unarmed carpus of the maxilliped 3 and the unarmed uropodal endopod. The discovery of a new mud-shrimp species in an easily accessible habitat indicates that the shallow-water infaunal decapods are still relatively poorly known. A partial segment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced from the holotype for future genetic studies.

The aims of the survey were to record the sponge biodiversity of the sublittoral and shallow-circalittoral and to provide information on in situ identification features. In total 24 sponge species were recorded, ranging from 0 to 12 species per site. The most widespread species were Dendrilla antarctica (10 sites), Sphaerotylus antarcticus (11 sites); and Mycale (Oxymycale) acerata (13 sites). Four species new to science were discovered and are described here: Megaciella cardenasi sp. nov., Crella (Crella) hennequinae sp. nov., Hymedesmia (Hymedesmia) noramaloneae sp. nov., Clathria (Clathria) priestleyae sp. nov. Suberites topsenti (Burton, 1929) is reassigned to Hemimycale topsenti (Burton, 1929) comb. nov. General habitat notes are provided for the survey sites, many of which were previously unsurveyed.

We here falsify this view, by describing five new species and providing new records of the previously known species, based on a material of over 80 specimens collected on Mindanao and Luzon. Clidicus forceps Cheng, Yin & Jaloszynski, sp. n., C. interfector Jaloszynski, Cheng & Yin sp. n., C kalis Jaloszynski, Cheng & Yin sp. n., C. occisor Jaloszynski sp. n., and C. shavrini Jaloszynski sp. n., are described. Clidicus crocodylus Jaloszynski, previously known to occur on Mindanao, is for the first time recorded in Luzon.

Accurate identification of Meloidogyne spp. is crucial and the first step to apply suitable management strategies to combat these nematode pests. Perineal-pattern morphology of female specimens is one of the most common characteristics used for identification. However, for some species various morphological characteristics are similar which makes it challenging to correctly identify species. In this study different morphological and morphometrical characteristics were used to identify 37 populations of Meloidogyne obtained during 2015 and 2016 from various crop production areas situated across different geographical regions in South Africa. A comprehensive study of females, males and secondstage juveniles (J2) of the 37 Meloidogvne populations isolated was conducted, revealing the presence of Meloidogvne enterolobii, M. hapla, M. incognita and M. javanica. Although three perineal-pattern characteristics proved to be useful in discriminating particularly between M. enterolobii and M. incognita females, most of the morphometric characters used to identify female, male and J2 individuals overlapped among the different species. Substantial intraspecies variation was also evident among different populations. The use of classical identification approaches alone could therefore not clearly distinguish among the 37 Meloidogyne populations studied. Therefore, the use of molecular techniques in combination with morphological and morphometrical analyses is suggested to be more accurate and reliable in discriminating between Meloidogyne spp.	[Rashidifard, Milad; Fourie, Hendrika] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Daneel, Mieke Stefanie] ARC TSC, Private Bag X11208, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa; [Marais, Mariette] ARC PHP, Biosystemat, Nematol Unit, Private Bag X134, ZA-0121 Queenswood, South Africa	Rashidifard, M (reprint author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.	miladrashidi10@yahoo.com		Rashidifard, Milad/0000-0001-5159-9277	National Research Foundation (NRF) [SUR20110707000020249]; North-West University	This work is based on the research supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) under Grant SUR20110707000020249.

NOV.; MELITIDAE; MEXIMAERA; SEA	Two species of the amphipod genus Ceradocus Costa, 1853 were collected from coastal areas in Japan: C. kiiensis sp. nov. from Wakayama Prefecture and C. laevis Olenid, 1970 from Okinawa Prefecture. Both of the species share the asymmetrical male gnathopod 2, the larger male gnathopod 2 with strongly oblique palm and the uropod 3 with wide rami. Ceradocus kiiensis also has the palm with a single excavation in the larger male gnathopod 2 and the pleonites 1-3 with many dorsal teeth. This new species can be distinguished from its congeners by the absence of the anterodistal projection on the basis of the larger male gnathopod 2, the presence of the posterior teeth on the pleonal epimera 1-2, and others. Ceradocus laevis is characterized by the palm having triangular and small trapezoidal projections in the larger male gnathopod 2, the pereopods 5-7 bases with rounded posterodistal lobe, the pleonites and urosomites lacking dorsal teeth. and the pleonal epimera 1-2 without posterior teeth. This species can be easily distinguished from C. kiiensis by the smooth dorsal margins of the pleonites. A key to Ceradocus species in Japan is provided.

These new species expand the distribution of the genus to the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Sclerothyone reichi sp. nov. is characterized by having body wall with multilocular two pillared tables with multiperforate disc and short spire, ending in a narrow crown of teeth; tentacles with rods and introvert with two pillared tables and rosettes; tube feet with only end plates. Sclerothyone oloughlini sp. nov. is distinctive in having a body wall with multilocular, two pillared tables; handles present and multilocular two-pillared tables; circular disc without handle; and plates (near the anus). The new species resemble each other in the tentacles with rods. However, Sclerothyone oloughlini sp. nov. stands apart from S. reichi sp. nov. in the introvert with rosettes; tube feet with two pillared supporting tables, arched plates and end plates. The possible assignment of Cucumaria nozawai Mitsukuri, 1912 and Thyone adinopoda Pawson & Miller, 1981 to Sclerothyone, and the position of Thyone neofusus Deichmann, 1941 in Temparena Thandar, 1989, are briefly discussed.

They are named Amynthas luridus sp. nov. and Amynthas ruiyenensis sp. nov. Both species are octothecal with the former found at elevations of 1500-2300 m and the latter at an elevation of 2200 m from the Central Mountain Range. In addition, DNA barcodes are made available for the first time for the following species: Amynthas catenus Tsai et al., 2001, Amynthas exiguus aquilonius Tsai et al., 2001, Amynthas proasacceus Tsai et al., 2001, Amynthas hohuanmontis Tsai et al., 2002, Amynthas tessellatus Shen et al., 2002, Amynthas fenestrus Shen et al., 2003, Amynthas tantulus Shen et al., 2003, and Amynthas uvaglandularis Shen et al., 2003. Furthermore, Amynthas exiguus ssp. aquilonius Tsai et al., 2001 distributed at elevations of 2200-3000 m in the Central Mountain Range is elevated to species level, as A. aquilonius Tsai et al., 2001. The highest altitude record so far for the exotic Eukerria saltensis (Beddard, 1895) in Taiwan, 2200 m above sea level, is documented. Moreover, some recent assignments of species to Amynthas and Metaphire and synonymies of names are critically discussed. It is argued that idiosyncratic genus concepts, inadequate species comparisons, and unexplained synonymies should be avoided. A hitherto undetected and possibly monophyletic species group of mainly Korean Amynthas species in the A. tokioensis-group is indicated, characterized by numerous genital papillae around each spermathecal pore and male porophore, large ampullae, long diverticula, large prostate glands, and manicate intestinal caeca. The names A. bimaculata, A. silvatica and A. surcata (Ishizulca, 1999), as well asA. odaesanensis, A. righii, A. fasciiformis, andA. sanchongensis Hong & James, 2001, previously declared as junior synonyms of A. tappensis (Ohfuchi, 1935), are revalidated.

J	Ruiz, GRS; Maddison, WP; Galiano, ME				Ruiz, Gustavo R. S.; Maddison, Wayne P.; Galiano, Maria Elena			A revision of the concept of Mago O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1882, and proposal of a new genus (Araneae: Salticidae: Amycini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						jumping spiders; Matinta; Neotropical; taxonomy	PHYLOGENY; REDESCRIPTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SPIDERS; MAFFT	In this paper we redescribe the type species of Mago O. Pickard-Cambridge,M intentus O. Pickard-Cambridge, and describe Mago brimodes Ruiz & Maddison sp. nov. from Ecuador. Based on both morphological features and the 16SND1 gene region, we concluded that the larger spiders traditionally identified as Mago, such as Mago acutidens Simon and related species, are not closely related to the small dark M. intentus (type species) and M. brimodes. Matinta Ruiz & Maddison gen. nov. is therefore proposed to hold most species previously included in Mago. The following species are transferred from Mago to the new genus: Matinta acutidens (Simon, 1900) comb. nov. (type species), Matinta apophysis (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) comb. nov., Matinta balbina (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) comb. nov., Matinta chickeringi (Caporiacco, 1954) comb. nov., Matinta delicata (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) comb. nov., Matinta fasciata (Mello-Leitao, 1940) comb. nov., Matinta fonsecai (Soares & Camargo, 1948) comb. nov., Matinta furcata (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) comb. nov., Matinta jurutiensis (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) comb. nov., Matinta longidens (Simon, 1900) comb. nov., Matinta mimica (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) comb. nov., Matinta opiparis (Simon, 1900) comb. nov., Matinta pardo (Costa & Ruiz . 2017) comb. nov., Matinta procax (Simon, 1900) comb. nov., ,Matinta saperda (Simon, 1900) comb. nov., Matinta silvae (Crane, 1943) comb. nov., Matinta similis (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) comb. nov., Matinta steindachneri (Taczanowski, 1878) comb. nov. and Matinta vicana (Simon, 1900) comb. nov.

J	Bidzilya, O; Budashkin, Y; Yepishin, V				Bidzilya, Oleksiy; Budashkin, Yuriy; Yepishin, Viktor			A review of the genus Ancylosis Zeller, 1839 (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae: Phycitinae) from Ukraine	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						Ancylosoma; new species; new synonymy; new host plants; Palaearctic region; Phycitinae	PYRALOIDEA LEPIDOPTERA; MEESSIIDAE; CHECKLIST; RECORDS; RUSSIA; MOTHS	Nine species of Ancylosis are recorded from Ukraine. Ancylosis larissae sp. nov. related to A. hellenica (Staudinger, 1870) and A. rhodochrella (Herrich-Schaffer, 1852), is described from Crimea. Ancylosis albicosta (Staudinger, 1870) is reported from Ukraine for the first time. Ancylosis albidella Ragonot, 1888, A. syrtella (Ragonot, 1887), A. rhodochrella, A. harmoniella (Ragonot, 1887) and A. monella Roesler, 1973 are removed from the list of Pyralidae of Ukraine due to misidentifications. The host plants for A. sareptalla (Herrich-Schaffer, 1861) and A. substratellum (Christoph, 1877) comb. nov. are recorded for the first time. New host plant is recorded for A. roscidella (Eversmann, 1844). The diagnoses for all species known from Ukraine are provided. The adults and genitalia of both sexes are illustrated for all Ukrainian species and some closely related species from adjacent territories. A key to the species is given based on external characters and the genitalia of both sexes. The female genitalia of A. deserticola (Staudinger, 1870), A. hellenica (Staudinger, 1870), A. sabulosella (Staudinger, 1879) as well as the male genitalia of A. pallida (Staudinger, 1870) are described and illustrated as they have been dealt incorrectly in literature. The status of A. albidella and the records of this species from Europe are discussed. The new synonymy is proposed: Ancylosoma Roesler, 1973 syn. nov. of Ancylosis Zeller, 1839 and A. sareptalla gulbaharensis Roesler, 1973 syn. nov. of A. sareptalla (Herrich-Schaffer, 1861). Ancylosis decolorella (Ragonot & Hampson, 1901) spec. rev., stat. nov. is taken out from synonymy with A. sabulosella. The lectotype of Myelois deserticola Staudinger, 1870 is designated.

Hamacantha (Vomerula) mamoi sp. nov. was collected from Sagami Bay, and Hamacantha (Vomerula) umisachii sp. nov. from off Hachijo Island. This is the first record of Hamacantha and the Hamacanthidae from Japan. H. (V.) mamoi sp. nov. is characterized by having styles, two types of diancistras and one of sigmas. Only two known species have the same spicule composition: H. (V.) acerata Levi, 1993 and H. (V.) esperioides Ridley & Dendy, 1886, described from New Caledonia, and south-west Africa and south-east South America, respectively. H. (V.) acerata has larger diancistras and much smaller sigmas compared with those of H. (V.) mamoi sp. nov. H. (V.) esperioides can be separated by having larger styles and smaller sigmas than those of H. (V.) mamoi sp. nov. H. (V.) umisachii sp. nov is characterized by having styles, diancistras, cyrtancistra-like diancistras and sigmas. Hamacantha (V.) carteri Topsent, 1904 seems to have similar spicule composition, however the size of all spicule types is different.

J	Sassi, D				Sassi, Davide			Revision of the Metallactus hamifer species-group (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Cryptocephalinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Pachybrachina; Neotropical Region; new species; new synonymy; lectotype designations; new combination; redescription; endophallus; spermatheca	COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY; BEETLES	The taxonomic revision of a group of Metallactus species, morphologically and chromatically close to M. hamifer Suffrian, 1866, is presented here. Before this revision catalogues had been reporting 12 species attributable to this group. In the present work one species has been synonymized and six have been described as new to science. Therefore, the group now includes 17 species. The species described as new are: Metallactus abditus sp. nov., M. chamorroi sp. nov., M. dicaprioi sp. nov.; M. madefactus sp. nov., M. praetorius sp. nov., M. viator sp. nov. The following synonymy is proposed: Metallactus albopictus Suffrian, 1866 (= Griburius persimilis Burmeister, 1877 syn. nov.). One additional species, formerly included in Griburius Haldeman, 1849 is transferred to Metallactus: Metallactus octoguttatus (Burmeister, 1877) comb. nov. Lectotypes were designated where necessary for stability of nomenclature. The new synonymies, the name-bearing type fixations and designations and the nomenclatural acts are critically discussed. An identification key for the species group is also provided.

Polyclad fauna of Agatti Island, Lakshadweep, India: new records and description of two new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Platyhelminthes; Pseudoceros; Marine flatworm; Taxonomy; novel species	NICOBAR ISLANDS; FLATWORMS PLATYHELMINTHES; PSEUDOCEROTIDAE; RHABDITOPHORA; TURBELLARIA; COTYLEA	The present paper deals with the first study of polyclad fauna from Agatti Island, Lakshadweep. Through this study, Pseudobiceors apricus, Pseudobiceros hymanae and Pseudoceros bolool are recorded for the first time from Lakshadweep waters while Pseudoceros bicolor is recorded for the first time from Indian waters. Description of two new species, Pseudoceros agattiensis sp. nov. and Pseuodoceros stellans sp. nov. is also provided with good quality photographs of external and internal details. Pseudoceros agattiensis sp. nov. is characterized by a brown to black background colour, with minute white spots, marginal band thick and black with minute white spots present at very edge of the margin, three dorsal longitudinal white bands, out of which, two are laterally branched. Pseudoceros stellans sp. nov. displays a brown background colour with a black marginal band and completely covered with lighter microdots and a unique pattern of white dorsal blotches. This study adds to the knowledge of Indian polyclads, which are still an understudied group from Indian waters.

Australian Nitidulinae: general review with descriptions of new genera and species (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						Cucujoidea; sap beetles; Gondwanan; taxonomy	PHYLOGENY; REVISION; COMPLEX	The classification of the subfamily Nitidulinae is reviewed, as it applies to those species occurring within Australia and its territories. Comments are made concerning the currently recognised tribes and generic "complexes" within this subfamily, Australian genera are briefly discussed, with reference to recent and proposed changes in their classification, and several new genera and species are described. The following new taxa are described: Aenigmoronia echinodes, gen. & sp. nov., Australycra similis, sp. nov.,Austronitidula multimaculata, gen. & sp. nov., Cychramus splendidus, sp. nov., Lasiodites howensis, sp. nov. and Temnelytron nigrum, gen. & sp. nov. The following synonymy is proposed: Stelidota nigrovaria (Fairmaire, 1849) (= Aethinodes variabile Lea, 1921), syn. nov. The genus Testudoraea Kirejtshuk, 1986, stat. nov., is recognised as a distinct genus, and Perilopsis australis Kirejtshuk, 1990 is considered to be an unnecessary replacement name for Testudoraea flava Kirejtshuk, 1986.

Two species are proposed as new combinations in genus Bathanthidium: Anthidium (s. str.) bicolor Wu, 2004, A. (s. str.) monganshanensis Wu, 2004. The two new combinations (B. bicolor, B. monganshanense) are in Bathanthidium (Manthidium), previously considered to include only the type species from Burma and Laos (published records from northeastern India and Malaysia are based on misinterpreted localities). Trachusa (Paraanthidium) concavum (Wu, 1962) and &ells siamensis Friese, 1925 are synonymized with B. binghami (Friese, 1901). Bathanthidium circinatum Wu, 2004 is transferred to Pseudoanthidium Friese forming the new combination P. (s. str.) circinatum (Wu, 2004). The distribution of each species is given, new distribution sites are marked by asterisk (*) especially. Our results confirm that the genus Bathanthidium has higher species diversity than previously documented and that this diversity is centered in China.

Both morphological and SSU rDNA data revealed that M. parakoi sp. nov. was distinct from other myxosporeans. Mature myxospores of M. parakoi sp. nov. were pyriform in the frontal view. The spores were 15.98 +/- 0.78 (14.59-17.72) mu m in length and 7.84 +/- 0.78 (6.66-9.75) mu m in width. The two polar capsules were pyriform and equal in size, exhibiting 8.72 +/- 0.50 (7.76-9.92) mu m in length and 3.03 +/- 0.23 (2.63-3.56) mu m in width. Polar filaments within the polar capsules were coiled with 11 or 12 turns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that M. parakoi sp. nov. and Myxobolus koi (FJ710800) were clustered together, forming a sister subclade with Myxobolus tanakai. This study also implied that the morphology of the myxospores was generally correlated with their phylogenetic relationship, while such correlation was not strong or consistent.

New species of Duplominona Karling, 1966 and Pseudominona Karling, 1978 (Platyhelminthes: Proseriata) from the Caribbean	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						meiofauna; Caribbean; Monocelididae; taxonomy; photographic holotypes	MONOCELIDIDAE PLATYHELMINTHES; KARYOMETRICAL ANALYSIS; MARINE; RHABDITOPHORA; TURBELLARIA; SYSTEMATICS	Nine new species of Duplominona and one new Pseudominona (Platyhelminthes, Proseriata, Monocelididae) are described from the Caribbean coast of Panama and from Puerto Rico. Duplominona aduncospina n. sp.; D. terdigitata n. sp.; D. pusilla n. sp.; D. bocasana n. sp. (from Panama) and D. dissimilispina n. sp.; D. chicomendesi n. sp.; D. macrocirrus n. sp.; D. diademata n. sp.; D. puertoricana n. sp. (from Puerto Rico) can be distinguished from the numerous congeneric species based on fine details of the sclerotized structures of the copulatory organ. Duplominona aduncospina n. sp. is characterised by a cirrus provided with 3-4 rows of recurve spines, 2-3 mu m long. D. terdigitata n. sp. shows a tripartite tail, and needle-shaped cirrus spines, 1.5-9 mu m long. Cirrus spines of D. pusilla n. sp. are scale-like, 1.5-3 mu m long. D. bocasana n. sp. has triangular spines, 1.5-6 mu m long. D. dissimilispina n. sp. has needle-shaped spines, 3.5-15 mu m long. D. chicomendesi n. sp. has a small cirrus, with few, strongly curved spines, 2-7.5 mu m long. D. macrocirrus n. sp. has a large cirrus, provided with spines 3-9 mu m long, with the longest spines placed medially. D. diademata n. sp. has a cirrus with two separate spiny areas, with spines 7-13 mu m long. D. puertoricana n. sp. has a very long cirrus, with poorly sclerotised proximal spines, and distal spines to 6 mu m long. A taxonomic key of the genus Duplominona is provided. Pseudominona cancan n. sp. from Panama differs from P. dactylifera from Bermuda, the only species known in the genus so far, for its shorter cirrus and fewer, triangular spines 3-5 mu m long, and for the position of the vagina, close to mouth. A specimen attributed to P. dactylifera collected in Puerto Rico is described. Distribution of the new species suggests a complete separation of Panamanian and Puerto Rican proseriate fauna, confirming previous reports of restricted ranges and high endemicity of mesopsammic Platyhelminthes.

The species Indoribates hauseri (Mahunka, 1997) comb. nov. (Haplozetidae) is recorded in Indonesia for the first time. A supplementary description for this species is given in detail on the basis of adult specimens from Indonesia and its main morphological traits are summarized. The taxonomic status of the genus Bolkiah Mahunka, 1997 is discussed, resulting in the following new taxonomic proposals: Indoribates (=Bolkiah syn. nov.).

This medium-sized Cnemaspis species is differentiated from all other Indian congeners by a suite of the following distinct morphological characters: heterogeneous mid-dorsal scales, 6-7 supralabials; 113-120 paravertebral rows of tubercles; 71-85 mid-dorsal scales; absence of spine-like tubercles on flanks; subimbricate, smooth ventral scales; 135-140 midventral scales; subdigital lamellae under fourth digit of manus 23-25; subdigital lamellae under fourth digit of pes 24-25; males with 7-8 precloacal pores; median row of subcaudals enlarged, smooth, a series of two large scales alternating, containing one divided scale; head and neck colouration brownish-yellow, consistent in adult males; adult females with orange coloured head and neck. Recent new descriptions of Cnemaspis species together with the present discovery show that the southern Western Ghats species have been overlooked by previous studies. Therefore we suggest further studies to evaluate the diversity of Cnemaspis in this region.	[Sayyed, Amit] Wildlife Protect & Res Soc, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Grismer, L.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the mitochondrial genes 12S and 16S rRNA and tRNA-val recover A. kyaiktiyoensis sp. nov. as the sister species to A. inthanon from Thailand but differs from it and other congeners by at least a 5.0% sequence divergence. It is further differentiated by the following combination of morphological characters: (1) maximum SVL 24 mm in males and females; (2) first finger shorter than second; (3) absence of interorbital and tarsal ridges; (4) presence of light-coloured interscapular spot; (5) presence of yellow rictal tubercle; (6) absence of wide, light-coloured patch below eye; (7) presence of large, discrete, bright-yellow submandibular spots along the underside of lower jaw; (8) iris yellow-gold; (9) presence of markings on the snout consisting of streaks below the eye to the lip, and on the canthus rostralis to the nostril; (10) dorsum grey-brown with orange-beige spots, a dark-brown X-shaped marking on the back surrounding the interscapular spot, and dark-coloured markings on rump; (11) fore-and hind limbs with orange-beige cross-bars; and (12) venter light-gray with yellow spotting, especially near flanks and underside of hind limbs. Ansonia kyaiktiyoensis sp. nov. is the westernmost known record for the genus and the only species west of the Salween Basin. Its discovery echoes the increasing number of herpetological discoveries being made in upland regions fringing the Ayeyarwady and Salween Basins.	[Quah, Evan S.

Cnemaspis amba sp. nov. and C. koynaensis sp. nov. are members of the C. girii clade and differ genetically from each other and other members of the clade by 7.9-19.6 % uncorrected ND2 sequence divergence. The two new species are also morphologically distinguishable from all regional congeners on the basis of condition of spine-like scales on flanks, heterogeneity of dorsal pholidosis, number of dorsal tubercle rows, number of tubercles in paravertebral rows, femoral pores, number of poreless scales between femoral pores in the precloacal-femoral scale row, and keeling and size of subcaudal scales. Cnemaspis amba sp. nov. differs from C. koynaensis sp. nov. in lacking spine-like scales on flanks and in the number of longitudinal ventral scales and ventral scales across mid-body. Both species are known only from their mid-elevation (similar to 800 m asl.) type localities. Discovery of two new species increases the total species of Northern Western Ghats (NWG) Cnemaspis to ten. Specific status of numerous genetically divergent lineages needs to be evaluated and it is likely that many more species remain to be discovered from the poorly explored NWG, which are typically considered low in species diversity relative to more southern regions. We also provide a table describing major diagnostic characters across all NWG Cnemaspis species and corrected type locality data for three recently named species-Cnemaspis ajijae, C. limayei and C. mahabali.

A molecular phylogeny derived from the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene revealed that Spinomantis mirus sp. nov. is sister to a clade containing the other two described species of the species complex, S. bertini and S. beckei, but strongly differentiated from these two species by 8.1-9.8% pairwise distances in this gene. DNA sequences from two nuclear genes revealed that S. mirus sp. nov. shares no alleles with these two species. Phenotypically, S. mirus sp. nov. differs from the other species of the complex by its larger size and some aspects of its coloration, including clear mottling on the flanks, tri-color banding on the legs, and distinct brown dots on the dorsum. The new species is so far only known from Pic d'Ivohibe Special Reserve. Its distribution thus appears to not overlap with those of the other two species, which as far as known are restricted to the Andohahela Massif in the extreme South-East of Madagascar, at a distance of about 250 km from Ivohibe.

SEM photos show that the bifurcated labella have on their ventral face rows of scalelike rasping teeth that may be used to graze on green algae, as the gut content of some specimens suggest. A reanalysis of the phylogeny of the genus using Australimyza mcalpineorum as designated outgroup and including I. azevedoi shows that all four groups of species previously proposed for the genus are monophyletic if I. anodonta is removed from the scoliostylus group. Inbiomyia anodonta and I. azevedoi are here transferred to the anemosyris group. In our results with implied weight, I. exul is sister to a Glade including all other species of the genus, while the scoliostylus group appears as sister to the Glade (mcalpineourum group + anemosyris group).

A few groups have colonised hygropetric habitats and fewer species still can possibly be referred to as terrestrial. Here we describe six new Copelatine species that were mainly found in dry shallow forest floor depressions in the eastern and northeastern lowland humid forests of Madagascar. Three new species are described in each of the two genera Copelatus and Madaglymbus: Copelatus amphibius sp. nov., Copelatus betampona sp. nov., Copelatus zanatanensis sp. nov., Madaglymbus kelimaso sp. nov., Madaglymbus menalamba sp. nov., and Madaglymbus semifactus sp. nov. Diagnosis, description, known distribution, ecology, and conservation notes are provided for each species. All species are illustrated with a dorsal habitus image, ventral and lateral views of the male penis, and parameres. Photographs of the unusual terrestrial habitats where the species were found are provided. Madaglymbus menalamba sp. nov. is also documented with macrophotos and videorecordings of the terrestrial locomotion and behaviour in the field. Although these species should not be classified as terrestrial, or even semi-terrestrial Dytiscidae, they seem to be specialists of very ephemeral aquatic habitats and stay put instead of disperse when the habitat dries up. It is hypothesised that this lifestyle and behaviour on Madagascar is restricted to the high-precipitation humid forest regions mainly in the east. It may also represent a transition step, or stepping-stone, towards becoming fully terrestrial, a step that the few known terrestrial Dytiscid taxa once passed through. It is very likely that this type of habitat is overlooked for aquatic beetles, not only in Madagascar, and the six species herein described may be just the "tip of the iceberg".

J	Hansen, T				Hansen, Thomas			Gastropods from the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary in Denmark	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Gastropoda; Maastrichtian; Danian; Ecology; Extinction; Biostratigraphy	UPPERMOST MAASTRICHTIAN CHALK; STEVNS-KLINT; TERTIARY BOUNDARY; MASS EXTINCTIONS; STABLE-ISOTOPE; SPECIES SURVIVORSHIP; DIVERSITY GRADIENT; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; LARVAL ECOLOGY; EAST TEXAS	Gastropods constituted one of the most successful faunal groups in the Danish Basin around the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary, both with regard to abundance and diversity. Only 19 species were known previously; this number is here increased to 140. The end-Cretaceous Danish fauna is represented by 79 taxa of which 85 % became extinct at the boundary. A new fauna of 72 species arose within a remarkably short time interval of less than half a million years. The extinction seems to have hit rather randomly with regard to feeding strategies, while geographical range stands out as the single most important factor in survivorship. The succeeding speciation was controlled by changes in substrate and food availability, where non-carnivores and taxa dependent on a hard substrate were replaced by hunting carnivores and mud-adapted taxa in response to the disappearance of the Cretaceous bryozoan mounds. The gastropod genus Loxotoma Fischer, 1885 is renamed as Palaeoloxotoma nom. nov. due to its junior synonymy with a moth. 38 new species are erected.

Two new species of miniature psammophilic sarcoglanidine catfishes of the genus Microcambeva from the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil (Siluriformes: Trichomycteridae)	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						biodiversity hotspot; clearwater rivers; Rio Jucu; Rio Mucuri; sand-dwelling fish; systematics	AMAZON BASIN; TELEOSTEI; RECOMMENDATIONS; CONSERVATION; EUTHANASIA	Trichomycterid catfishes of the Sarcoglanidinae, which includes small-sized species living in sandy river substratum, have been poorly represented in collections. We herein describe two new species of the sarcoglanidine genus Microcambeva, endemic to river basins draining the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The presence of a distal widening on the posterior process of the autopalatine and a rudimentary anterior autopalatine ossification shared by the two new species, M. mucuriensis sp. nov. from the Rio Mucuri and M. jucuensis sp. nov. from the Rio Jucu basin, and M. draco from the Rio Jucuru?u basin indicates that these three species are more closely related to each other than to other congeners. Microcambeva mucuriensis seems to be more closely related to M. draco than to M. jucuensis in that the first two species share the presence of a well-developed anterior process of the interopercle. The two new species are also distinguished from congeners by the number of opercular odontodes and premaxillary teeth, and the relative size of the sesamoid supraorbital. Available evidence taken from this study and previous reports indicates that different sarcoglanidine lineages have adapted to live in distinct riverine habitats, with species of Atlantic Forest Microcambeva inhabiting clearwater streams and Amazonian sarcoglanidines found in tea-stained acidic-water streams.

Unlike other members of the genus, this species is a commensal with the burrowing scale worm Pelogenia zeylanica (Willey) (Annelida: Sigalionidae) that lives in fine sand sediments. Specimens were always found attached to the dorsal surface of the anterior end of the host body. This species has a ligament lithodesma between diverging hinge teeth, which is characteristic of Montacutona Yamamoto & Habe. However, it is morphologically distinguished from the other members of this genus in having elongate-oval shells with small gape at the posteroventral margin and lacking an outer demibranch. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the four-gene combined dataset (18S + 28S + H3 + COI) indicated that this species is monophyletic with Montacutona, Nipponomontacuta Yamamoto & Habe and Koreamya Lutzen, Hong & Yamashita, which are commensals with sea anemones or Lingula brachiopods. This result suggests that host shifting across different phyla occurred at least twice in this clade.

This portion of the Lower Guinean ichthyoprovince is relatively unknown with very few collections occurring since the 1960s. Sampling in the Rio Mongo, a tributary to the Rio Wele, yielded two Chiloglanis species; one putatively ascribed to the widespread species C. cameronensis, and the other species having similarities with C. harbinger described from the Lokoundje River in Cameroon. Morphometric analyses between the specimens from Rio Mongo and paratypes of C. harbinger confirm that they are distinct species and should be described as such. Here we describe Chiloglanis mongoensis sp. nov., a narrow endemic species only known from one locality in the Rio Mongo. We provide measurements from paratypes of C. harbinger and emphasize the need for further expeditions in the area.

On closer examination the specimens were determined to represent a distinct species, endemic to the Tana River basin, which is herein formally described. The new species is readily diagnosed from N. fluviatilis by higher counts of lateral line, pre-dorsal, and caudal peduncle circumferential scales, higher numbers of pectoral rays, lower numbers of anal fin rays, and a shorter anal-fin base length.

Unfortunately, our attempts to locate additional type material failed, and we conclude that they have been lost. The type localities of the material examined include the Red Sea, West and Central Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, Indonesia, The Philippines, and the Bismarck Sea, reflecting the extensive biogeographical distribution of this genus throughout the Indo-Pacific Ocean. A neotype was designated from the northern Red Sea for X. umbellata, and sequencing established its position in the phylogenetic tree in relation to other genera of the family Xeniidae. In addition, X. flexibilis n. sp. was described from The Philippines. The findings from the current study led to the synonymizing of X. actuosa with X. sansibariana and of X. plicata with X. blumi. Overall, the study has re-described the types of 17 species considered to be valid based on morphological characters. Validation of the morphological features of original type material along with species-diagnostic genetic characters are required in order to facilitate our ability to correctly employ Latin binomials, both in phylogenetic studies and in any other biological surveys.

Up to now, it is only recorded from Bunaken National Park, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. A combination of histological, computer tomographic and scanning electron microscopic methods was applied in order to describe and illustrate the anatomy of Moridilla jobeli sp. nov. in detail. Furthermore, we conducted molecular analyses which include available partial COI and 16S rRNA sequences, as well as the nuclear gene Histone 3 (H3) of Facelinidae and Aeolidiidae. NeighborNet analyses, species delimitation tests and phylogenetic reconstruction methods show the distinctiveness of the new species from the type specics Moridilla brockii Bergh, 1888 and the two recently described species Moridilla fifo Carmona & Wilson, 2018 and Moridilla hermanita Carmona & Wilson, 2018, as well as the monophyly of the genus. A phylogenetic analysis of the Facelinidae and Aeolidiidae does not result in a resolved tree, therefore relationship of former assumed closely related genera, Noumeaella Risbec, 1937 and Palisa Edmunds, 1964, cannot be discussed in detail.

Five species of Euryleptidae encountered during surveys in the intertidal rocky shores of Ratnagiri, Maharashtra are presented in the current study. Cycloporus i'ariegatus is new records to India. Cycloporus australis and C. reticulatus are new records to India and reported for the second time after their first formal descriptions in 1982 and 2002 respectively. Eurylepta aurantiaca is a new record to the Indian ocean. The study also describes the new species Stylostomum mixtomaculatum sp. nov. and it is the first report of the genus Stylostomum from the tropical realms. Since Stylostomum and Acerotisa are known to be closely allied genera, efforts have been made to review their species assemblages and throw light on the existing ambiguities within the available information. With this report, the number of euryleptid species from Indian waters increases to eight.

Herein, two of these species, Ilyocypris dentifera Sars, 1903 and Ilyocypris japonica Okubo, 1990, are redescribed, and a third species, Ilyocypris incus sp. nov., is described and named. This latter species has previously been reported from Japan and possibly Korea under the names Ilyocypris angulata Sars, 1903 and I. dentifera, but study of the hemipenes demonstrates that it is a separate species. Ilyocypris nipponica Okubo, 2004 nomen nudum previously reported from Japan is herein considered to be a junior synonym of I. dentifera. Tuberculated and non-tuberculated forms of both I. dentifera and I. japonica were recovered during this study and the presence or absence of tubercles is postulated to be related to environmental conditions, such as water chemistry or predation pressures. Although tuberculated forms of I. dentifera do occur, we concur with some previous studies that Ilyocypris angulata Sars, 1903 should be treated as a separate species, based on features of the hemipenes and carapaces. Figures of the carapaces and hemipenes of I. angulata, and Ilyocypris mongolica Martens, 1991, which is morphologically very close to I. japonica, are also presented for comparisons. This study confirms that three species of Ilyocypris inhabit North East Asian rice fields: I. dentifera, I. japonica and Ilyocypris incus sp. nov. Extant Ilyocypris species in North East Asia, including those from habitats other than rice fields, can be divided into two groups based on the Zenker organ, hemipenis, and sixth limb morphologies. These groups are postulated to represent two distinct lineages of Ilyocypris in North East Asia.

The genus is easily recognised by external morphology; body elongate, pronotum with a longitudinal impression on the disc and elytra striate and punctate. In this paper, based on the study of several international reference collections, we propose two new combinations, and describe two new species of Cylloepus (C. bispoi sp. nov. and C. segurae sp. nov.) from Ecuador and Bolivia.

Thus, H. stejnegeri sensu stricto is restricted to Kyushu Island. Of these four species, H. kuishiensis sp. nov. contains two distinct mitochondrial lineages, but this split is not reflected in differentiation of allozyme (nuclear genome) markers. These species are morphologically similar to each other but can be differentiated by several characteristics, especially in combination of dorsal coloration, the number of vomerine, upper, and lower jaw teeth, and depth of vomerine teeth series. In coloration, H. guttatus sp. nov. is brown or dark brown mostly with tiny white to brownish white marking, while H. tsurugiensis sp. nov. is dark brown with bright yellow continuous markings. Hynobius kuishiensis sp. nov. is reddish purple or dark brown with small to continuous brownish white markings, in contrast to reddish purple or dark brown with small to large brownish white markings in H. stejnegeri.

It differs from the only congener, Arctozenus risso (Bonaparte, 1840), in the reduction of pigments on body, a more slender body, and longer head, snout and jaws. A neotype is designated for Paralepis risso Bonaparte, 1840 and Paralepis borealis Kroyer in Gaimard (1847). Note on synonymy of Paralepis risso is provided. Observation of adults of Notolepis annulata, Magnosudis prionosa and Paralepis coregonoides found loss of teeth on jaws and gill arches, suggesting more species in the subfamily Paralepidinae may commonly possess this character in adults.

The new goby belongs to the Gobius-lineage (Gobiinae). Examination of the single known specimen exhibits a unique combination of morphological characters which could not be fitted to any known genus. Gymnesigobius gen. nov. is morphologically distinguished from all other genera in the Gobius-lineage by the following combination of characters: chin without fold or barbels; mouth terminal with anterior tip above horizontal level of lower eye edge; predorsal area and first dorsal fin base naked; pelvic fin anterior membrane well developed; head with anterior oculoscapular and preopercular canals, posterior oculoscapular canal absent; pores of head canals enlarged, e.g. pores alpha and rho larger or of about the same size as interspaces to pore beta; six transverse suborbital rows of sensory papillae, four continuous suborbital rows in front of row b, fifth row divided in three parts but in front of row b, sixth row just as superior part above row b and below pore alpha; longitudinal suborbital row b barely reaching forward to the vertical from posterior edge of eye. A full description of the new genus and species is provided. The new species, collected at a depth of between 344 and 364 m (mean depth of 354 m), is one of very few gobiid species found at bathyal depths.

J	Jeong, MK; Soh, HY; Suh, HL				Jeong, Man-Ki; Soh, Ho Young; Suh, Hae-Lip			Three new species of Heteromastus (Annelida, Capitellidae) from Korean waters, with genetic evidence based on two gene markers	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Genetic comparison; histone H3; morphology; mtCOI; new species	POLYCHAETA	Three undescribed species of Heteromastus Eisig, 1887 were collected from intertidal to sublittoral habitats in western and southern waters of Korea. Heteromastus namhaensis sp. nov. is distinguishable from other congeners by the presence of hemispheric notopodial lobes in the posterior abdomen. Heteromastus gusipoensis sp. nov. closely resembles H. tohbaiensis Yabe & Mawatari, 1998 in the absence of posteriorly extended abdominal notopodial lobes, but differs in the absence of eyespots on the prostomium and distinct node on the shaft of thoracic hooks in H. gusipoensis. Heteromastus koreanus sp. nov. is similar to H. filiformis sensu Hutchings & Rainer, 1982 in the shape of abdominal notopodia, but clearly differs in dentition of the abdominal hooks and methylene green staining pattern (MGSP). DNA sequences (mtCOI and histone H3) of these new Korean species were compared with all sequences of Heteromastus species available in the public database. Molecular results showed distinct genetic differences among these three new Korean species at species level. Comparison of mtCOI gene revealed significant genetic difference between H. filiformis and these Korean species.

This review is restricted to the Copelatus species that have fewer than ten elytral + one submarginal stria, including all species except those of the erichsonii species group. Both morphological and molecular (mitochondrial COI) data are used in an integrative taxonomic approach. Thirteen species are recognised, of which five are described as new: Copelatus ankaratra sp. nov., Copelatus kely sp. nov., Copelatus pseudostriatus sp. nov., Copelatus safiotra sp. nov. and Copelatus vokoka sp. nov. Copelatus unguicularis Regimbart, 1903 and Copelatus apicalis Fairmaire, 1898 are both transferred to the genus Madaglymbus Shaverdo & Balke, 2008 (comb. nov.). Copelatus mimetes Guignot 1957 is a junior synonym of the widespread Afrotropical-Arabian Copelatus pulchellus (Klug, 1834) (syn. nov.). Copelatus marginipennis (Laporte, 1835) is reinstated (stat. nov.) as a valid species with Copelatus aldabricus Balfour-Browne, 1950 and Copelatus aldabricus var. simplex Guignot, 1952 as junior synonyms (syn. nov.). We designate lectotypes for Colymbetes marginipennis Laporte, 1835 and Copelatus obtusus Boheman, 1848. Copelatus peridinus Guignot, 1955 is recorded for Madagascar for the first time and Copelatus nodieri Regimbart, 1895 is rejected as a species present in Madagascar.

They belong to eight different genera in four subfamilies namely, Syllinae: Haplosyllis Langerhans, 1879, Megasyllis San Martin, Hutchings & Aguado, 2008, Opisthosyllis Langerhans, 1879, Trypanosyllis Claparede, 1864; Eusyllinae: Eusyllis Malmgren, 1867, Odontosyllis Claparede, 1863; Exogoninae: Salvatoria McIntosh, 1885; and Autolytinae: Myrianida Milne Edwards, 1845. Trypanosyllis mercedesae n. sp., is here formally described and distinguished from congeners. Trypanosyllis richardi Gravier, 1900 is re-described, adding important taxonomic information to the original description, based on specimens collected from Djibouti (Gulf of Aden). We provide new insight into the reproduction of Megasyllis heterosetosa (Hartmann-Schroder, 1991) with the description of a specimen with an attached female dicerous stolon, full of oocytes. Odontosyllis polycera (Schmarda, 1861) is described because it is newly recorded for the Indian Ocean. We also provide some remarks about Myrianida pachycera (Augener, 1913), collected with a chain of stolons.

Johnius taiwanensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from other Johnius species by having a grayish dorsal half of body divided by a clear line from a whitish ventral half, and a black spot at the dorsal half of pectoral-fin axil, appearing as a distinct dot at the most dorsal point of the pectoral-fin base. First dorsal fin black tipped, other fins pale to dusky but never darkly pigmented. The species lacks distinctly enlarged teeth on upper and lower jaws. Body scales ctenoid, moderately large, with five or six rows between first dorsal-fin origin and lateral line. It is one of the most abundant sciaenids found in the shallow coastal waters (<20 m) of southeast mainland China and the west coast of Taiwan. It has often been misidentified as J. macrorhynus in the region. Phylogenetic analysis from all 27 sciaenid species found in Chinese waters based on the complete COI and 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that the genus Johnius is monophyletic and J. taiwanensis is placed as a sister species of J. trewavasae. Acoustic analysis has shown that J. taiwanensis produces a unique sound among fishes in Taiwan coastal waters.

The new species is assigned to the genus Cophyla based on molecular phylogeny and morphological similarities to other species of this genus. Molecular phylogenetic analysis resolved Cophyla fortuna sp. nov. as closely related to C. noromalalae. However, the two species were reciprocally monophyletic both in a tree reconstructed from a combination of mitochondrial genes, and in a tree based on the nuclear RAG-1 gene. The new species, previously identified as candidate species Cophyla sp. Ca4, occurs in lowland bamboo forests around the Marojejy Massif in northeastern Madagascar. It differs from the allopatric C. noromalalae, so far only known from the Montagne d'Ambre Massif in northern Madagascar, by slightly smaller body size and shorter duration and higher spectral frequency of advertisement calls. Several additional genetically divergent mitochondrial lineages of Cophyla, related to the C. fortuna/noromalalae complex and to C. phyllodactyla, occur in intervening areas between Montagne d'Ambre and Marojejy, and their status requires further study.

An Appalachian Plateau population occurs in northern and central West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania, and a mountain population occurs in the Allegheny Mountains and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of the Virginias. Herein we describe the mountain population as Cambarus fetzneri sp. nov. The two species differ genetically and morphologically, and have different color patterns. Specifically, C. fetzneri sp. nov. chelae lack extensive red coloration on the distal end of the propodus and dactyl, possess rostral margins that lack any red coloration, compared to C. monongalensis, which has extensive red coloration on the dactyl and propodus, as well as red rostral margins. Morphologically, the rostrum of C. fetzneri sp. nov. is shorter and wider than that of C. monongalensis. Also, adult C. fetzneri sp. nov. are considerably smaller in body size than those of C. monongalensis.

J	Anker, A				Anker, Arthur			On three symbiotic species of the alpheid shrimp genus Salmoneus Holthuis, 1955 from the Indo-West Pacific, including one new to science (Malacostraca: Decapoda: Caridea)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Alpheidae; Callianassidae; Salmoneus; decapod crustaceans; caridean shrimp; new species; new records; symbiosis; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean	SP-NOV.; CRUSTACEA; LOMBOK	Three species of the alpheid shrimp genus Salmoneus Holthuis, 1955 associated with burrows of other decapod crustaceans are reported from various Indo-West Pacific localities. Salmoneus venustus sp. nov. is described based on material collected at two distant localities, Nha Trang Bay, southern Vietnam, the type locality of the new species, and the Yiti-Sifah region east of Muscat, northern Oman. Both specimens were collected with the aid of a suction pump applied to burrow entrances or mounds in muddy sand; the holotype was possibly associated with burrows of the callianassid ghost shrimp, Glypturus sp. Salmoneus venustus sp. nov. shares many characteristics with S. latirostris (Coutiere, 1897), including the red banding of the pleon, but can be distinguished from S. latirostris and all other species of the genus by a unique combination of morphological characters. The large-sized Salmoneus brucei Komai, 2009 is reported from Sumba, central Indonesia, representing a significant southward extension of the species' previously known distribution range and the first record since its original description. The callianassid ghost shrimp Lepidophthalmus cf. rosae (Nobili, 1904) is recorded as a new host of S. brucei. Finally, Salmoneus colinorum De Grave, 2004, associated with burrows of larger snapping shrimps from the Alpheus malabaricus Fabricius, 1798 species complex, is reported for the first time from Madang, Papua New Guinea, representing an eastward extension of the species' previously known distribution range.

Salmoneus durisi sp. nov. is characterised principally by both chelipeds enlarged, robust, with ventral and dorsal margins of chelae carrying long fine setae, and with minor chela fingers armed with a few large teeth on cutting edges. All specimens of Salmoneus durisi sp. nov. were collected either directly from burrows of larger decapod crustaceans with the aid of a suction pump, or by exposing burrows dug under large subtidal rocks. The Iranian specimen was found together with its presumed host, Neocallichirus calmani (Nobili, 1904). Two additional specimens from Indonesia and the Solomon Islands are tentatively assigned to S. cf. durisi sp. nov., awaiting further studies.

J	Anker, A				Anker, Arthur			The eastern Pacific species of Salmoneus Holthuis, 1955, with description of a remarkable new species from Las Perlas Archipelago, Panama (Malacostraca: Decapoda: Alpheidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Salmoneus; Alpheidae; Caridea; Pacific Ocean; new species; new records	SHRIMP; CRUSTACEA; CARIDEA; GENUS; COAST	The present study deals with five species of the alpheid shrimp genus Salmoneus Holthuis, 1955 from the tropical eastern Pacific. One of them is new to science and is described as Salmoneus tiburon sp. nov. The new species is presently known only from the Las Perlas Archipelago in Panama and can be distinguished from all other congeners by the dentition on the cutting edges of the major chela, with some dactylar teeth reminiscent of shark teeth. It is also one of the largest species of the genus, with the carapace length of both type specimens surpassing 8.0 mm. Salmoneus serratidigitus (Coutiere, 1897), a species with an ample distribution across the Indo-Pacific, is recorded for the first time from the Pacific coast of Panama and is confirmed from Colombia. Salmoneus malagensis Anker & Lazarus, 2015, previously known only from Bahia Malaga in Colombia, is recorded from Panama's Azuero Peninsula. The remaining two species, S. excavatus Anker, 2011 and S. alvarezi Anker & Lazarus, 2015, are recorded regionally from Las Perlas Archipelago in Panama and Playa Tarcoles in Costa Rica, both for the first time since their original descriptions. An identification key to the five currently known eastern Pacific species of Salmoneus is provided. However, several immature and/or incomplete specimens herein preliminarily reported as Salmoneus spp., as well photographic records from southern California, USA, indicate the presence of further undescribed species in the eastern Pacific.

J	Wang, ZH; Mound, L; Tong, XL				Wang, Zhaohong; Mound, Laurence; Tong, Xiaoli			Phylogenetic relationships within the Frankliniella genus-group based on morphology, with a revision of Iridothrips (Thysanoptera, Thripidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						New synonym; new combination; new species; host associations; monophyly		The Frankliniella genus-group comprises over 270 species in ten genera. It is one of the important groups in Thripinae, and includes some important pests. A phylogenetic analysis of genus-level relationships within the Frankliniella genus-group was performed, based on 55 morphological character states scored for 23 species representing 11 genera, including an outgroup, Thrips physapus. Six most parsimonious trees were generated from the analysis under equal weighting schemes. Pseudanaphothrips was recovered as monophyletic, and as sister group to a clade comprising five genera, Yaobinthrips, Parabaliothrips, Sitothrips, Firmothrips, Kakothrips, in which Parabaliothrips showed to be a paraphyletic group. Frankliniella was paraphyletic, with Frankliniella zizaniophila + Iridothrips + Pelikanothrips kratochvili forming one clade that was sister group to the rest of the species of Frankliniella + Guerothrips moundi. According to the phylogenetic analysis, Guerothrips is proposed as a new synonym of Frankliniella, and Pelikanothrips is considered a new synonym of Iridothrips. The genus Iridothrips is revised with a key to five species, including I. zizaniophila comb. n., I. kratochvili comb. n. and I. lobulatus sp.n.. A key to the eight members of the Frankliniella genus-group is provided.

A new large cynodont from the Late Permian (Lopingian) of the South African Karoo Basin and its phylogenetic significance	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						anatomy; Changhsingian; epicynodont; Gondwana; phylogeny	TROPIDOSTOMA ASSEMBLAGE ZONE; CLADISTIC RELATIONSHIPS; THERAPSIDA CYNODONTIA; CRANIAL ONTOGENY; MASS EXTINCTION; EARLY EVOLUTION; THEROCEPHALIA; PROCYNOSUCHUS; MORPHOLOGY; PATTERNS	The Karoo Basin of South Africa has the best global record of Lopingian (Late Permian) non-mammaliaform cynodonts, currently represented by five species. We describe Vetusodon elikhulu gen. et sp. nov., documented by four specimens from the Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone. With a basal skull length of similar to 18 cm, it is the largest Lopingian cynodont and is also larger than Induan representatives of the group. Vetusodon elikhulu has a cranial morphology that departs notably from that previously documented for Permo-Triassic cynodonts. It features a short and extremely wide snout, resembling that of the contemporaneous therocephalian Moschorhinus, and has large incisors and canines that contrast with the small unicusped postcanines, suggesting a more important role of the anterior dentition for feeding. The dentary is extremely long and robust, with the posterior margin located closer to the craniomandibular joint than in other Lopingian and Induan cynodonts (e.g. Thrinaxodon). The secondary palate morphology of V. elikhulu is unique, being short and incomplete and with the posterior portion of the maxilla partly covering the vomer. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that V. elikhulu is the sister taxon of Eucynodontia and thus the most derived of the Lopingian to Induan cynodonts yet discovered.

A NEW PEIROSAURID CROCODYLIFORM FROM THE UPPER CRETACEOUS LAGO COLHUE HUAPI FORMATION OF CENTRAL PATAGONIA, ARGENTINA	ANNALS OF CARNEGIE MUSEUM			English	Article						Colhuehuapisuchus lunai; Crocodyliformes; Mesoeucrocodylia; paleobiogeography; paleoecology	SAN JORGE BASIN; MONTEALTOSUCHUS-ARRUDACAMPOSI CROCODYLIFORMES; BAJO BARREAL FORMATION; BAURU BASIN; AEOLOSAURUS-COLHUEHUAPENSIS; DINOSAURIA ORNITHISCHIA; NEUQUEN BASIN; SP-NOV.; MESOEUCROCODYLIA; MORPHOLOGY	Peirosaurid crocodyliforms were diverse and abundant in the Cretaceous of the Gondwanan landmasses, especially South America. Here, we describe Colhuehuapisuchus lunai, gen. et sp. nov., a new peirosaurid taxon from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian-? lower Maastrichtian) Lago Colhue Huapi Formation of southern Chubut Province in central Patagonia, Argentina. Although represented by only the anterior similar to one-third of the mandible with several complete, in situ teeth, the new taxon exhibits a combination of distinctive morphologies that does not occur in other peirosaurids, including several mandibular and dental autapomorphies. The symphyseal region of the Colhuehuapisuchus mandible is transversely wider than that of any other representative of Peirosauridae, and as such the new form may be most closely related to other broad-snouted peirosaurids such as Barrosasuchus neuquenianus, Gasparinisuchus peirosauroides, and Patagosuchus anielensis. The exceptional diversity of snout and tooth shapes among definitive and probable members of Peirosauridae suggests the existence of a variety of ecological and dietary preferences within the clade. Colhuehuapisuchus constitutes the southernmost peirosaurid occurrence worldwide and arguably the youngest record from Patagonia, thereby expanding the paleobiogeographic range of these distinctive mesoeucrocodylians to nearly the end of the Mesozoic and the southern tip of South America.

The peninsular toad and Bornean P. signata are very similar to each other morphologically, although slightly different in relative forelimb length, dorsal coloration, and tuberculation. However, in partial mtDNA sequence, the peninsular toad is substantially distinct from P. signata from Borneo and P. brevipes from the Philippines, although it is close to a congener from Sumatra. Thus, the peninsular toad is described as a new species based on specimens from Genting Highlands, state of Pahang, central Peninsular Malaysia. Of the two morphotypes recognized in the genus, the new species belongs to the one with the tips of the fingers expanded into truncate discs, in which the new species is the smallest in body size. The new species also occurs in Singapore and possibly in Sumatra.

Systematics of Huicundomantis, a new subgenus of Pristimantis (Anura, Strabomantidae) with extraordinary cryptic diversity and eleven new species	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Andes; cryptic diversity; integrative taxonomy; Neotropics; Pristimantis phoxocephalus species group; P. cryptomelas species group	NICHE MODELS; FROGS; PHYLOGENY; ALIGNMENT; SUPPORT	Pristimantis is the most diverse genus of tetrapods comprising 532 described species. It contains a large number of morphologically cryptic species that are being discovered with the assistance of genetic evidence. We use molecular, morphological, bioacoustic, and environmental data to assess the phylogenetic relationships and determine the species within an Andean Glade of Pristimantis, which is distributed from central Ecuador to northern Peru. We assign to this Glade the name Huicundomantis and propose it as a subgenus. Our results show that Huicundomantis is composed of two large clades which we name as the P. phoxocephalus species group and the P. cryptomelas species group. Huicundomantis is composed of 28 species of which 12 have been described and 16 are new. We describe 11 of these undescribed species. The most effective characters to discriminate among species are DNA sequences, qualitative morphology, and advertisement calls. Morphometric and environmental characters are not very useful to define species limits. We clarify the identity of P. riveti and show that populations from southern Ecuador traditionally ascribed to P. riveti are a new species, P. lutzae sp. nov. We also show that P. prometeii is a junior synonym of P. harapatusami. The current diversity and geographic distribution of Huicundomantis are consistent with a model of allopatric speciation. All species have a restricted distribution range (less than 4330 km(2)) and are assigned to the Red List categories Data Deficient or threatened with extinction. We provide new reasons to increase conservation efforts for these species and their habitat. Taking our results into account, Pristimantis species richness in Ecuador increases from 211 to 221 species, and the number of species endemic to Ecuador from 119 to 129.

Superficial and light microscopical observation of the shell showed that the borings were made by a bryozoan belonging to the genus Penetrantia. Conventional techniques such as endocasting with the dissolution of the shell are impossible for type material. The application of non-destructive micro-CT-scanning of the shell revealed the three-dimensional arrangement of the entire colony within the shell. Careful analysis of the structure of the autozooids of the colony revealed that the species could not be assigned to any known species; we accordingly describe it as Penetrantia bellardiellae Schwaha, n. sp. The application of micro-CT not only allowed the depiction of the new bryozoan species but also revealed the remains of a hermit crab located within the shell. The shell of Bellardiella crassilabris thus represents the type specimen of two species and contains a member of a third phylum inside. To our knowledge, this is a unique case, which also emphasizes the usefulness of micro-CT imaging for precious specimens as well as the importance of historical museum collections.

Compared with known extinct zorapterans, the new species possesses eight-segmented antennae and can be readily distinguished from all other extinct and recent members of the order in the presence of a shallow groove connecting two antennal sockets and by unique spination of the metafemur and metatibia. The earliest known suspicious mating behavior of Zoraptera, the intromittent organ of the fossil zorapterans, the egg, and the earliest known basal plate of the male genitalia are briefly discussed. The genitalia of new species are used as an intromittent organ in the majority of mating patterns among living zorapterans. The mating patterns (a copula is performed by males and females) of the most extant species have been present since at least the mid-Cretaceous. A shared similar aedeagal structure in the new species and in the most extant species suggests an analogous mating behavior.

Cotton is cultivated in Sindh on more than 1 million acres. Two popular varieties of cotton are grown in Sindh. The aim of the present study was to determine the diversity of plant parasitic and soil nematodes associated with cotton plants in Sindh. During 2017-2018 extensive surveys were conducted at the time of cropping and at harvesting and soil root samples were collected from different fields in the cotton producing regions of five districts of Sindh viz., Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Mityari and Tando Allahyar. The analysis of samples resulted in the identification of one new species of soil nematode viz., Acrobeloides gossypii n. sp., along with three new record species viz., Tylenchorhynchus ewingi Hopper, 1959; T. crassicaudatus Williams, 1960 and Pratylenchus pseudofallax Cafe-Filho & Huang, 1989.

We describe here a new species of Pristimantis from the northwestern Andes of Colombia. The species was found between 2000-2500 m.a.s.l., mostly within moss hanging of tree branches in a tropical cloud forest. It can be easily distinguished from other Pristimantis species of the western Andes by the unique black and white patterning in the ventral surface and the flanks, the hourglass-shaped dorsal folds, and the prominent conical tubercles on eyelids, heels, and outer edge of tarsus. A phylogenetic analysis further supports its status of a lineage reciprocally monophyletic to P. satagius and separated by a genetic distance of 0.03; the latter species bear whitish rather than predominantly black ventral coloration. To the best of our knowledge, this species is only known from the 2,500 ha nature reserve Mesenia-Paramillo, despite other research on this area of the country. Therefore, the species is declared vulnerable while new evidence on its distribution range is accumulated.

J	Tanabe, Y; Kakui, K				Tanabe, Yuki; Kakui, Keiichi			Two Hexapleomera species from Japan, with a new species description and discussion of phylogenetic relationships within Hexapleomera (Crustacea: Tanaidacea)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Malacostraca; Peracarida; North Pacific; aquarium; sea turtle; integrative taxonomy	PERACARIDA; POSITION	We describe Hexapleomera sasuke sp. nov. and provide a supplemental redescription of Hexapleomera urashima Tanabe et al., both of which are based on specimens collected in Japan. Hexapleomera sasuke closely resembles H. urashima, sharing a uropod with four articles, maxillipedal endites with two tiny dorso-subdistal and two distal spiniform setae, a labium with the palp fused to the outer lobe, and the pereopod-1 propodus with an inner subdistal plumose seta. The new species differs from H. urashima in having the basal article of pleopod 3 with three outer plumose setae, the chelipedal carpus with three or four dorsodistal simple setae, the region between the bases of the chelipedal dactylus and fixed finger with three or four simple setae, and deeply pigmented pleopodal rami. We determined partial sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene (655 nt) from H. sasuke, which proved to be 15.0-15.3% divergent from H. urashima in Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) distance; also in partial sequences of 18S rRNA gene (1888 nt after alignment), 0.8% divergent (K2P distance) was detected between two species. Based on morphology and molecular data, we discuss phylogenetic relationships within Hexapleomera, and propose two morphologically distinct groups, the robusta group and the wombat group.

J	Costa, WJEM				Costa, Wilson J. E. M.			Description of a new species of cynopoeciline killifish (Cyprinodontiformes, Aplocheilidae), possibly extinct, from the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Biodiversity; conservation; moist tropical forest; systematics; taxonomy	SEASONAL KILLIFISHES; GENUS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; TELEOSTEI; RIVULIDAE; TAXONOMY	Specimens found between 1985 and 1988 in the Mage River Basin, south-eastern Brazil were misidentified as L. splendens. The recent rediscovery of other specimens in the Estrela River Basin near the type locality of L. splendens has clarified the species' concept, making it possible to recognise the Mage River Basin specimens as a new species. The new species is herein described as Leptopanchax sanguineus sp. nov. and is distinguished from all other cynopoecilines by a unique colour pattern in males, including red bars with sinuous margins. It was collected in a well-preserved, temporary shallow swampy area within dense moist forest, but since 1990 the species has not been found again. Leptopanchax sanguineus sp. nov. is one of three species of cynopoeciline killifishes living in lowland moist forests of the coastal plains of Rio de Janeiro State, where the greatest diversity of endemic cynopoecilines is concentrated. Each of these species has been recorded a single time in the last 30 years, a surprisingly low record attributable to intense deforestation during the last several decades resulting in small fragmented lowland moist forests of today. This study indicates that seasonal killifishes adapted to uniquely live in this kind of habitat should be regarded with special concern in studies evaluating conservation priorities.

We reviewed the taxonomic status of populations of D. brevipollicatus from states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, including some continental islands, based on external morphology. We tested our morphological species by a DNA-barcoding approach with sequences of 16S RNA ribosomal gene fragment. DNA-barcoding analysis included other recognized Dendrophryniscus species and was concordant with morphological species diagnosed in our review. Intraspecific genetic distances ranged from 0 to 2.72 % (+/- 0.91 %). Interspecific distances ranged from 3.35 % (+/- 0.90 %) to 20.15 (+/- 2.23 %). Optimal threshold values ranged from 2.8 % to 3.0 % and barcode gap analysis showed that for all individuals the furthest intraspecific distances was always lower than the closest non-conspccific individual. Seven distinct species were recognized. A ncotype for D. brevipollicatus was designated and described; the type locality was determined for the Acude da Solidao (22 degrees 57'S, 43 degrees 17'W, Datum WGS 84; 410 m altitude), Parque Nacional da Tijuca, Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Liopeltis pallidonuchalis sp. nov. is distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following characters: one single (or missing) loreal; one single nasal shield; dorsal scales in 15-15-15 rows, all smooth; 1 preocular, 2 postoculars and 1 + 2 temporals; 7 supralabials, of which 3(rd) and 4(th) in contact with the eye; 8 infralabials; nasal contacting internasal; prefrontal touching or separated from supralabials; ventral scales 126-138; subcaudal scales 67-73, paired; relative tail length about 0.274-0.301; an uniform bronze body colouration; a thin postocular stripe extending from eye to end of the neck becoming indistinct posteriorly. The new species differs from the morphologically closest species Liopeltis frenata by the lower number of ventrals and subcaudals, by characteristic colouration and significant divergence in cytochrome b mtDNA gene sequences (p = 15.3-15.6%). The new species is currently known from northen and central parts of the Annamite (Truong Son) Mountains, central Vietnam, and was recorded from montane evergreen tropical forests of Kon Tum-Gia Lai Plateau (Gia Lai and Thua Thien-Hue provinces, Da Nang City) at elevations of 950-1010 m asl to karst tropical forests in Quang Binh Province in the north at elevation 150 asl. We suggest the new species should be considered as Vulnerable (VU) following the IUCN's Red List categories. An updated taxonomic key to the Liopeltis species is provided.

The Afrotropical braconine genus Dioxybracon Granger with descriptions of four new species and new generic synonymy	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Dioxybracon; Pedinopleura; Aspidobraconina; new species; new synonymy; key	HYMENOPTERA	The braconine parasitoid wasp genus Dioxybracon Granger, 1949 was known from a single species, D. bimucronatus Granger, from Madagascar. Three new species from the African mainland are described and illustrated, and a key provided to enable identification of Afrotropical species. The new species are D. maridadi Quicke & Butcher sp. n. from Uganda, D. aurumoram Quicke & Butcher sp. n. from Ghana and D. vannoorti Quicke & Butcher sp. n. from South Africa. D. bimucronatus is redescribed and illustrated photographically, and is recorded from the Aldabra Atoll for the first time. The morphology of the new species considerably blur the boundary between Dioxybracon and Pedinopleura van Achterberg, 1984, described species of which are from Japan, Papua New Guinea and Australia. In particular, we note that the holotype of D. bimucronatus differs from its redescription in having tergites 4-6 with deep basal grooves rather than shallow ones, a state used previously to differentiate it from Pedinopleura. Here we therefore formally synonymise Pedinopleura with Dioxybracon.	[Quicke, Donald L.

Description of a new genus and species of Chrysopetalidae (Annelida: Polychaeta) from the NE Atlantic, with some further records of related species	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Deep-sea; Bay of Biscay; Horseshoe Abyssal Plain; Gulf of Cadiz; symbiotic species	MUD VOLCANOS; NAUTILINIELLIDAE; GULF; PHYLLODOCIDA; MOLLUSCA; SEEPS	Five chrysopetalid species are reported from samples collected at bathyal depths in three NE Atlantic regions: the Bay of Biscay, the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and the Gulf of Cadiz. Arichlidon reyssi (Katzmann et al., 1974), Dysponetus caecus (Langerhans, 1880) and D. profundus Boggemann, 2009 are free-living forms found mainly on biogenic substrates (e.g., coral and sunken wood). A brief description and taxonomical remarks are given for each of these species and their geographical distributions and habitat records were updated accordingly. Natsushima bifircata Miura, & Laubier, 1990 and Craseoschema thyasiricola gen. et sp. nov. are symbionts inhabiting the mantle cavity of chcmosynthcsis-based bivalves known from four mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz. Craseoschema thyasiricola gen. et sp. nov. was found inside a thyasirid bivalve and presents mixed morphological characteristics of free-living and symbiotic forms within Calamyzinae Hartmann-Schroder, 1971. A full description of the new species is given together with DNA sequences of the genes COI, 16S and H3 that were used in a phylogenetic analysis to indicate the position of the new genus within the family.

(Nematoda: Oncholaimidae) from the lucky strike hydrothermal vent field (Mid-Atlantic Ridge)	BMC ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Oncholaimus dyvae sp. nov.; Hydrothermal vents; Deep sea; Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios	FATTY-ACIDS; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; INDICATOR; MEIOFAUNA; SEDIMENTS; TUBEWORM; BEHAVIOR; EDIFICE	Background: Nematodes are an important component of deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities, but only few nematode species are able to cope to the harsh conditions of the most active vent sites. The genus Oncholaimus is known to tolerate extreme geothermal conditions and high sulphide concentrations in shallow water hydrothermal vents, but it was only occasionally reported in deep-sea vents. In this study, we performed morphological, genetic and ecological investigations (including feeding strategies) on an abundant species of Oncholaimus recently discovered at Lucky strike vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 1700 m water depth. Results: We described this species as Oncholaimus dyvae sp. nov.. This new species differs from all other members of the genus by the combination of the following characters: body length (up to 9 mm), the presence of a long spicule (79 mu m) with a distally pointed end, a complex pericloacal setal ornamentation with one precloacal papilla surrounded by short spines, and a body cuticule with very fine striation shortly posterior to the amphid opening. Overall, O. dyvae sp. nov. abundance increased with increasing temperature and vent emissions. Carbon isotopic ratios suggest that this species could consume both thiotroph and methanotrophic producers. Furthermore sulfur-oxidizing bacteria related to Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were detected in the cuticle, in the digestive cavity and in the intestine of O. dyvae sp. nov. suggesting a potential symbiotic association. Conclusions: This study improves our understanding of vent biology and ecology, revealing a new nematode species able to adapt and be very abundant in active vent areas due to their association with chemosynthetic micro-organisms. Faced by the rapid increase of anthropogenic pressure to access mineral resources in the deep sea, hydrothermal vents are particularly susceptible to be impacted by exploitation of seafloor massive sulfide deposits. It is necessary to document and understand vent species able to flourish in these peculiar ecosystems.

Species of Eatoniana. having the plume-like setae on terminal segments of leg IV, reveal the high consistency of characters, confirmed both for extinct and extant members of the genus. The main difference between Eatoniana crinita sp. nov. and other "plume-footed" congeners is the shape of modified setae arising at genu and tibia IV.

The main distinctions of Podapolipus gryllacridi n. sp. from its described congeners from orthopterans are the larval female and adult male having all dorsal and ventral idiosomatic setae, except the greatly elongated pair of scapular setae (and the caudal setae of the larval female), reduced to the size of microsetae; the larval female having separate tergites C and D; the male having an entire prodorsal shield, with apex of the aedeagus between bases of setae v(1); and the adult female having smooth dorsal shields. Novel biological features of this parasite include its adult females' dwelling in the hollow sternal apodemes of their host, and its larval females using their host's other parasite, a gamasine mite, as phoretic and facultative hyperparasitic hosts. Keys are presented for the larval females and adult males of Podapolipus species associated with orthopterans. Problems with the generic concept of Podapolipus and closely related genera are reviewed. This is the first record of a podapolipid associated with orthopterans of the family Gryllacrididae.

New Notophthiracarus species (Acarina, Oribatida, Phthiracaridae) and overview of the distribution of the genus in South Africa	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						ptyctimous mites; fauna; systematics; morphology; Afrotropical region	PTYCTIMOUS MITES ACARI; KNOWLEDGE	Notophthiracarus (Oribatida, Phthiracaridae) is a large genus of ptyctimous oribatid mites with species in Australasian, Ethiopian, Neotropical, Oriental and Subantarctic regions, mostly in tropical and subtropical areas. Herein, we describe two new species from the Western Cape of South Africa: Notophthiracarus sidorchukae Niedbala sp. nov. and Notophthiracarus spathulatus Niedbala sp. nov. Each is represented by adult specimens collected from soil in a coastal forest in the Kaaimansgat estuary, the only documented locality. These two bring the known South African fauna of Notophthiracarus to 31 species, all of which are either indigenous or endemic. A review of distributional data shows that within South Africa most species have been recorded from southern, eastern and northeastern parts, and are most prevalent near the coast, where woody vegetation dominates.

Anderemaeus (Acari, Oribatida)-overview, three new species from South America and reassessment of Anderemaeidae supported by ontogeny	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						oribatid mites; Gondwanan soil fauna; Caleremaeidae; Gustavioidea; Cepheoidea; identification key	ORIBATID MITES ACARI; CONVERGENT EVOLUTION; JUVENILE INSTARS; NORTH-AMERICA; BIODIVERSITY; TENUIALIDAE; ACARIFORMES; MORPHOLOGY; DIAGNOSES; CATALOG	Anderemaeus is a genus of Gondwanan soil-dwelling oribatid mites with seven of the eight previously known species being South American. We propose two new species from Chile- A. sidorchukae sp. nov. and A. dentatus sp. nov.- and a third from Ecuador, A. mataderoensis sp. nov. Juveniles of the former two species are described, comprising the first such data for Anderemaeidae: nymphs notably lack both exuvial scalps and centrodorsal gastronotic setae, and the opisthonotal gland opens on a distinct stalk. The generic description is revised and expanded and a key to known species of Anderemaeus is presented, including A. tridactylus comb. nov. We reject the inclusion of Anderemaeus in a broad concept of Caleremaeidae and the implied subsumption of Anderemaeidae. as them are no synapomorphics linking the taxa. Anderemaeus species possess derived traits-e.g. adult with circumpedal carina and nymphs with smooth cuticle and no scalp retention-that are absent from Caleremaeus but are shared with more derived brachypyline taxa. The higher classification of Anderemaeus is reviewed: an analysis of known traits is inconclusive regarding both the generic composition of Anderemaeidae and its superfamilial relationships. However, on the strength of juvenile morphology, we propose the transfer of Anderemaeidae to Gustavioidea.

J	Colloff, MJ				Colloff, Matthew J.			The oribatid mite genus Topalia in Australia (Oribatida: Nosybeidae) and the taxonomic status of related families and genera	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Mite; taxonomy; morphology; systematics; character state analysis; phylogeny	INTERESTING MITES; ACARI ORIBATIDA; IDENTIFICATION KEYS; EASTERN PART; FAUNA; SYSTEMATICS; MADAGASCAR; AMERICA; MUSEUM; NORTH	Five new species of Topalia (Nosybeidae) are described from Australia: Topalia caliginosa sp. nov. from Victoria, T. corinnensis sp. nov. from Tasmania, T. dunlopi sp. nov. and T. katyae sp. nov. from Norfolk Island and T. royi sp. nov. from New South Wales. The genus was known previously from Australia from unidentified specimens only. I revise the generic definition, provide a key to species and clarify the family placement and taxonomic status of Topalia, Nosybea, Lamellocepheus and Charassobates. From a phylogenetic analysis and identification of synapomorphies, I consider Topalia, Nosybea and Lamellocepheus are valid, morphologically related and included in the Nosybeidae. The superfamily Charassobatoidea is valid, and contains Charassobatidae, Nosybeidae and Microtegeidae. These families have synapomorphies of a narrow, elongate subcapitulum, minute notogastral setae with at least one pair in the d series retained in the adults (dm in Nosybeidae, dp or dm in Microtegeidae, full complement in Charassobates). Immatures of Nosybeidae and Microtegeidae are undescribed, but in Charassobates are eupheredermous, plicate, and the tritonymph has the full complement of setae in the d series. Charassobates and Topalia have the synapomorphy of a ventral plate tectum, providing strong evidence for their relatedness. By way of contrast, the Cepheoidea, in which Nosybeidae and Microtegeidae have been placed by various authors, have a broad subcapitulum, well-developed setiform notogastral setae positioned marginally and lacking the d series, and no ventral plate tectum. The immatures are eupheredermous but non-plicate and the tritonymph lacks setae in the d series. Based on these differences, Nosybeidae, Microtegeidae and Charassobatidae cannot be included in the Cepheoidea.

Indopacifica iohanna sp. n. was found on the coasts of the Philippines and can be distinguished from its congeners by the lack of a ventral tooth on the claws. The larva and nymphs of this species show the same type of plication and setation typical for juveniles of other selenoribatid mites. Indopacifica mauritiana sp. n. was discovered on the coast of Mauritius and can be separated from its congeners by possessing only vestigial lamellar setae. A morphometric comparison of these two species and Indopacifica pantai from Thailand and Malaysia showed a clear separation between the three species. The known distribution of the genus Indopacifica stretches now from Mauritius in the West to the Philippines in the East and further occurrences within this area should be expected.

Morphologically, the new species is very similar to the North American species, Naiadacarus fashingi, with the only diagnostic character being the shorter tibial solenidion phi II in the former species. Unlike some Naiadacarus species, which am truly aquatic, Naiadacarus sidorchukae probably does not inhabit fully aquatic habitats. This species and other presumably non-aquatic taxa, may represent the ancestral condition in the genus Naiadacarus, and, therefore are critical in studying land to water ecological transitions that have occurred in this mite genus. The monotypic genus Naiacus Nesbitt, 1990 is considered as a junior synonym of Naiadacarus Fashing, 1974 (syn. n.), with its type-species, Naiacus muertensis Nesbitt, 1990, recombined as Naiadacarus muertensis (Nesbitt, 1990), comb. n.

The new genus includes T. sidortschukae sp. nov. (Chukotka and Okhotsk coast), T. kurilensis sp. nov. (Kuril Islands) and T. lindrothi (Sellnick, 1974) (Iceland) comb. nov. The female of T. lindrothi (Sellnick, 1974) is considered conspecific with the male of Parasitus (Neogamasus) anderssoni Sellnick, 1974, comb. nov., syn. nov. All three Thalassogamasus species are seaside dwellers, inhabiting sandy beaches, salt marshes, and seaweed accumulations. Keys to the species (females and males) are presented. Peculiar morphological aspects of the dorsal shields, peritremes, and leg tarsi of the new genus are discussed. For another littoral species of Parasitidae, Parasitus kempersi Oudcmans, 1902, a new combination is established, Phorytocarpais kempersi (Oudemans, 1902) comb. nov. Three littoral species of Uropoda (Phaulodinvchus) Berlese, 1903 are first recorded from Russia: U. (P.) japanorepleta Hiramatsu, 1980 (northern and eastern Chukotka, Magadan Region, Kuril Islands), U. (P.) marilima Hiramatsu, 1977, and U. (P.) marihirschmanni Hiramatsu, 1977 (Kuril Islands).

Eulimacrostoma microsculpturata Souza & Pimenta gen. nov. and sp. nov. parasitizes a starfish of the genus Luidia and has an elongated, conical, straight, or slightly curved shell, a protoconch with a brownish spiral band and convex whorls, a peculiar large and broad aperture with a strongly protruding outer lip, and microsculpture of axial lines on the teleoconch. Four other species are included in the genus, all from the western Atlantic: Eulimacrostoma chascanon (Watson, 1883), comb. nov., Eulimacrostoma fusus (Dall, 1889), comb. nov., Eulimacrostoma lutescens (Simone, 2002), comb. nov., and Eulimacrostoma patula (Dall & Simpson, 1901), comb. nov. Newly available material of Eulimacrostoma patula expands the known geographic distribution of this species in the Caribbean to the north coast of Brazil. Eulimacrostoma chascanon and Eulimacrostoma fusus and Eulimacrostoma lutescens are known only by the type series which was re-examined. A redescription is provided for Eulimacrostoma chascanon and Eulimacrostoma fusus. Species within Eulimacrostoma differ mainly by teleoconch sculpture, the presence or absence of an umbilical fissure, and shell dimensions. Lectotypes are designated for Eulimacrostoma chascanon, Eulimacrostoma fusus, and Eulimacrostoma patula.

Additional material from Karpathos is also included. In total, 48 species are recorded, and five new species (Drassodes mylonasi Chatzaki sp.n., Echemus kaltsasi Chatzaki sp.n., Minosiella apolakia Chatzaki sp.n.. Phaeocedus vankeeri Chatzaki sp.n., and Turkozelotes attavirus Chatzaki sp.n.) are proposed.

Riethia (Kieffer 1917) (Diptera: Chironomidae) revised for the Austro-Pacific region	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Australia; New Zealand; New Caledonia; new species; life stages; volsella; clypeus		Riethia Kieffer, known previously from New Zealand for a species stated to be also in Australia plus several Australian and South American species, is revised for the Austro-Pacific region. The three previously-described Australian species Riethia stictoptera Kieffer (the genotype), Riethia cinctipes Freeman and Riethia plumosa Freeman are distinct and valid, and are redescribed in all stages. In contrast, Riethia zeylandica Freeman now is restricted to New Zealand: Australian specimens previously allocated to R. zeylandica belong to several new species recognised on morphology of adult male, pupa and larva, with guidance from molecular data. Most belong to a widespread eastern Australian Riethia azeylandica sp. n.: others are allocated to Riethia hamodivisa sp. n., Riethia paluma sp. n., Riethia phengari sp. n. and Riethia queenslandensis sp. n., each with a more restricted range. From Western Australia three species, Riethia donedwardi sp. n., Riethia noongar sp. n. and Riethia wazeylandica sp. n., are described as new from adult male, pupa and larva. Riethia kakadu sp. n. is described from the monsoonal tropics of Northern Territory from the adult male and tentatively associated pupa. From New Caledonia a reared species is described as Riethia neocaledonica sp. n.. Illustrated identification keys are provided for the males, pupae and larvae. Unassociated larvae that key to reared described species are excluded from type status, and based on morphology and molecular evidence three unreared larval types, 'A', 'B' and 'C', are also described and keyed. Previously reported molecular vouchers are reviewed, and certain Genbank accessions re-identified. Extensive data shows Riethia are distributed almost throughout Australia from standing and flowing waters, from tropics and subtropics to cool temperate Tasmania, but probably only in permanent and standing waters. The immature stages of several taxa can co-occur: as many as four can be found simultaneously in one site. Terminology of the volsellae of the male genitalia and the dorsal head and maxilla of the larva is reviewed.

A taxonomic reappraisal of the Smooth Slug Snake Asthenodipsas laevis (Boie, 1827) (Squamata: Pareidae) in Borneo with the description of two new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Pareas; reptile; conservation; endemic biodiversity; Malaysia	PENINSULAR MALAYSIA; NATURAL-HISTORY; MONTANE; RESURRECTION; PHYLOGENY; SCINCIDAE; BOULENGER; GECKOS; RANGE	A review of the taxonomic status of the Smooth Slug Snake (Asthenodipsas laevis) in Borneo resulted in the discovery of two previously unrecognised species from the highlands of Sabah, East Malaysia. Asthenodipsas jamilinaisi sp. nov. and A. stuebingi sp. nov. are presumed to be closely related to A. laevis based on similarities in pholidosis and patterning but can be separated from A. laevis by their dorsal scale rows of 15/15/15 vs 15/15/13 and the presence of a sharp vertebral keel. Asthenodipsas jamilinaisi sp. nov. can be further differentiated from A. stuebingi sp. nov. by the greatly enlarged size of the vertebral scales, higher number of ventrals in males (173-175 vs 165), higher number of subcaudals (53 vs 35-47) and colour pattern (dark overall with indistinct bands vs lighter head and body with clear, distinct bands and a dark neck patch). The discovery highlights the need for more careful examination of much of the herpetofauna of Borneo that still remains underestimated and understudied. There is an urgent need for continued surveys into its diversity and the collection of genetic material for integrated taxonomic revisions.	[Quah, Evan S. H.; Anuar, M. S.

A new species of tree snake (Dipsadoboa, Serpentes: Colubridae from 'sky island' forests in northern Mozambique, with notes on other members of the Dipsadoboa werneri group	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Africa; biodiversity; Colubridae; new species; reptiles; snakes; species discovery	PHYLOGENY; CHECKLIST; REPTILES; NAMULI; MABU; BIODIVERSITY; NOTHOPHRYNE; HUBNER; DNA	A new species of tree snake Dipsadoboa montisilva Branch, Conradie & Tolley sp. nov. (Serpentes: Colubridae) is described from the 'sky islands' of Mount Mabu and Mount Ribaue in northern Mozambique. Features of scalation, colour, body form and habitat distinguish the new species from other Dipsadoboa. This is supported by a phylogenetic analysis using one mitochondrial marker (cytochrome b) that shows the new Mozambican species is divergent from other sampled Dipsadoboa, including D. flavida and D. aulica, the only congeners known to occur in Mozambique. Morphologically, the new Dipsadoboa forms part of the D. werneri-shrevei complex from east and southeast Africa, but differs in having higher subcaudal counts, a different temporal pattern and only two supralabials entering the orbit. Phylogenetically, it occurs in a clade with D. shrevei and D. werneri. The status of D. shrevei in East Africa is reassessed, particularly in terms of the poorly-known Dipsadoboa shrevei kageleri from northern Tanzania. It is morphologically well defined from D. shrevei shrevei and utilises a different habitat. Although based on limited genetic data, it appears to be well-defined from typical D. shrevei and is accordingly raised to specific status. The only Tanzanian record for typical D. shrevei from Mtene, Rondo Plateau in southeast Tanzania is well isolated from the species, range to the west (e.g. Zambia, Angola) and the published scalation features, particularly ventral counts, do not fully accord with D. shrevei. The Rondo Plateau population is treated as Dipsadoboa incerta sedis, and because we return D. shrevei to its binomial status, we can no longer consider D. shrevei as occurring in Tanzania. Biogeographically, the Rondo Plateau population may have a stronger affinity to the new Mozambican species. The discovery of isolated populations of the new species in mid-altitude forest remnants on Mt Mabu and Mt Ribaue emphasizes the high conservation importance of the Mozambique forest 'sky islands' from which numerous other endemic new species have been recently discovered. These species are impacted by ongoing habitat destruction through slash and burn clearing for subsistence agriculture.

A peculiar new species of gall-inducing, clearwing moth (Lepidoptera, Sesiidae) associated with Cayaponia in the Atlantic Forest	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Cucurbitaceae; insect galls; Melittina; Neosphecia cecidogena; Neotropical region; Premelittia; sesiid moths; taxonomy	REGION	Larvae of most clearwing moths (Lepidoptera, Sesiidae) are endophagous borers of many angiosperms, including their fruits, stems, and roots. Their localized feeding may lead to swellings on those plant parts, but whether the structures produced should be considered true galls is still controversial. In this study we describe a peculiar sesiid moth, Neosphecia cecidogena sp. nov. whose larvae induce unusual, external galls on Cayponia pilosa (Vell.) Cogn. (Cucurbitaceae) in the Atlantic Forest of southernmost Brazil. The adults, egg, larva, pupa and the gall are described and illustrated based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Galls are cylindrical and unilocular; they are induced individually on axillary buds of the C. pilosa stem. Unlike larvae of other sesiids, those of N. cecidogena sp. nov. lack abdominal pseudopodia, and show reduced stemata and chaetotaxy. Pupation occurs inside the gall, after having overwintered in the last larval instar. A maximum likelihood tree constructed based on mitochondrial DNA (COI) sequences showed that N. cecidogena sp. nov. is monophyletic and has an average distance of 13% to species of Melittia. The genera Neosphecia Le Cerf, 1916 stat. rev., Premelittia Le Cerf, 1916 stat rev., and Melittina Le Cerf, 1917 stat. rev. are restored from synonyms of Melittia Hubner, 1819 ["1816"].

The present study expands current knowledge of the genus Macrobrachium in Zaomu Mountain Forest Park, Guangdong Province based on the morphology, colouration, distribution, and molecular characteristics of Macrobrachium maculatum, M. inflatum, M. nipponense, and an undescribed new species, M. laevis. Macrobrachium laevis sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of characters, which includes the shape of rostrum, smooth carapace, and male second pereiopod. Macrobrachium laevis sp. nov. displays striking colour pattern, which could help to distinguish this species from other congeneric species in living specimen. Furthermore, the molecular characteristics of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) showed that this species has a sufficient interspecific divergence from its congeners.

No species of this genus have been known from Japan, although a species that is now assigned the name Lobus trimucronatus (Hermann, 1917) was once treated as an Ammophilomima species. In the present study, two new Ammophilomima species are recorded for Japan; i. e. A. amamiensis sp. nov. from Amannoshima Is. and Tokunoshima Is. and A. rikioi sp. nov. from Okinawa Is. Morphological characteristics that distinguish these two Japanese species from other Ammophilomima species and those that separate the Japanese species are presented.

Despite their isolated locations and small land area, these islands each support one or two species of the genus Heterolepisma Escherich. A phylogenetic analysis based on 23 morphological characters conducted using 14 adequately described Heterolepismatinae revealed deep rooted phylogenetic divergences and a new genus Maritisma is erected for Al coralinium sp. nov.; Heterolepisma dispar Uchida from Japan is transferred to the new genus. Heterolepisma howense Womersley is redescribed from the type material and additional specimens from Lord Howe Island; it is also the only species of Heterolepisma so far found on Norfolk Island. Heterolepisma milledgei sp. nov. is described from both Lord Howe Island (including Blackburn Island in its lagoon) and Balls Pyramid. Heterolepismapyramidum sp. nov. is described from Balls Pyramid. Maritisma coralinium gen. nov., sp. nov. and H. heraldense sp. nov. are described from the Herald Cays; both are considered as endangered by rising sea level however H. heraldense sp. nov. may be conspecific with the inadequately described II. rouxi Silvestri from New Caledonia.

J	Tauber, CA				Tauber, Catherine A.			South American Nothochrysinae (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae): I. Description of Nothochrysa ehrenbergi sp. nov.	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Archaeochrysa; Chile; fossils; Green lacewing; wing venation	GREEN LACEWINGS NEUROPTERA; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION	A new species, Nothochrysa ehrenbergi sp. nov., is described from Chile; it is the first species of Nothochrysa to be reported from the Southern Hemisphere and only the second from the New World. The genus now contains six extant species as well as two species known from late Oligocene and Miocene fossils. An updated catalog of the valid Nothochrysa species is presented, and three nomina dubia are discussed. The inclusion of the new species in Nothochrysa is well supported by morphological features. However, it and other species currently in the genus also share significant features with Archaeochrysa, an older genus of Nothochrysinae which is known only from the Eocene (Ypresian) to the late Oligocene. It therefore appears that N. ehrenbergi is among the least derived Nothochrysa species, and that the separation of Archaeochrysa from Nothochrysa is open to question and further examination.

In addition to its high diversity and ecological prevalence, the genus is also characterized by the predominantly intraspecific dimorphism, with major and minor workers. Currently, five fossil species are known, all of which are represented only by minor workers. A new species, dagger Pheidole anticua sp. nov., is described from Dominican amber, based on a major worker. Additionally, the identity of the currently known fossil species in Pheidole is discussed and dagger P. cordata from Baltic amber is considered as incertae sedis, resulting in no Pheidole species currently recognized for Baltic amber.

J	Diez, YL; Reygel, P; Artois, T				Diez, Yander L.; Reygel, Patrick; Artois, Tom			Schizorhynchia (Platyhelminthes, Rhabdocoela) from eastern Cuba, with the description of fifteen new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Greater Antilles; Kalyptorhynchia; meiofauna; microturbellarian; Turbellaria	TURBELLARIA; KALYPTORHYNCHIA; COAST; GENUS	We report on the schizorhynch species collected in a survey in the eastern region of Cuba. Eighteen species were identified, of which only three are known to science: Cheliplana asica, C. terminalis, and Carcharodorhynchus flavidus. The 15 new species belong to three different genera: Cheliplana (five species), Carcharodorhynchus (four species), and Schizochilus (six species). The five new species of Cheliplana (C. gibarenha sp. n., C. santiaguera sp. n., C. spuriaseminalis sp. n., C. subproximalis sp. n. and C. verrucosa sp. n.) differ from their congeners in the detailed morphology of the proboscis hooks and the atrial organs. The proboscis hooks bear a distal small hook in C. verrucosa sp. n., a feature only shared with C. paradoxa. Two of the four new species of Carcharodorhynchus (C. smilodon sp. n. and C. papillaris sp. n.) are very similar to C. flavidus in that the toothed belts of the proboscis are not continuous. However, they clearly differ from that species and from each other in the detailed construction of the teeth and copulatory organ. Carcharodorhynchus spiniformis sp. n. and C. nativus sp. n. can also be distinguished from the other species of Carcharodorhynchus by the detailed construction of the proboscis teeth and copulatory organ. The six new species of Schizochilus here described show a spiny cirrus around a central stylet. Two species lack the distal sclerotized cap of the copulatory bulb: S. favus sp. n. and S. bueycabonensis sp. n.. All new species of Schizochilus can be distinguished from each other and their congeners by the detailed construction of the hard parts (cirrus and stylet) of the copulatory organ.

Nennalpheus gabonensis sp. nov. is described based on a single but complete male specimen collected in mediocre visibility conditions at 11 m depth on a rocky reef north of Libreville, Gabon. The new species presents a substantial number of morphological differences from the two other species of Nennalpheus, especially in the armature of the cheliped fingers. The previously known distribution range of Nennalpheus sibogae (De Man, 1910), the type species of the genus, is extended significantly to include the Central Pacific (Hawaiian Archipelago) and the Indian Ocean (Glorioso Islands in the Scattered Islands group, and Mayotte Island in the Comoro Archipelago). In addition, new illustrations of N. sibogae are provided, including the previously not figured mouthparts and high-quality, contrasting background colour photographs. Field observations indicate that Nennalpheus is able to produce a weak snapping sound by rapidly closing one or both chelipeds, a previously suspected, but never observed behaviour.

This new species pertains to the denominated Synalpheus "Gambarelloides" species group sensu Coutiere (1909)-previously known as "Laevimanus" group. It was collected in the southern part of the Island, during episodes of extreme low tides, known locally as "puja". Synalpheus amintae sp. nov. is closely related to the only two other known species of the S. "Gambarelloides" species group from the eastern Pacific: Synalpheus occidentalis Coutiere, 1909, from Gulf of San Jose, Lower California, and Synalpheus mulegensis Rios, 1992, from Bahia Concepcion, Gulf of California, and can be differentiated from them by the poorly developed distal portion of pollex of the major cheliped, the armature of the distal segment of third maxilliped, and the number of acute teeth of exopodal uropod. A discriminative analysis dealing with other three species of Synalpheus from the western Atlantic, with distinctive pollex of major chela reduced, is presented. A dichotomous key was elaborated to identify the species of Synalpheus "Gambarelloides" species group from the eastern Pacific. The number of valid species described of Synalpheus from the eastern Pacific is increased to 23.

The new genus has characters present in other genera of Itaquasconinae but in a unique combination. The spiral thickening of the bucco-pharyngeal tube is also present anteriorly to the insertion point of the stylet supports, excluding only the short portion where the apophyses for the insertion of the stylet muscles (AISM) are present. This character is similar to Astatumen Pilato, 1997 but Meplitumen gen. nov. differs from this genus as stylet furcae are shaped differently and as stylet supports and placoids are present. The presence of a spiral thickening in a portion of the buccal tube anterior to the stylet supports distinguishes the new genus from Mesocrista Pilato, 1987, Platicrista Pilato, 1987 and Itaquascon de Barros, 1939. Meplitumen gen. nov. also differs from Mesocrista, in having the caudal processes of the AISM pointing laterally (instead of postero-laterally), and the apices of the caudal processes of the stylet furcae unswollen. From Itaquascon the new genus also differs by having more robust stylet supports, pharyngeal bulb with placoids, stylet furcae differently shaped. Meplitumen gen. nov. also differs from Platicrista in having caudal processes of the AISM more robust and not flexible, and more slender stylet supports. The new species, Meplitumen aluna sp. nov., has a cuticle with a very faint roughness at the caudal extremity of the body, and eyes probably absent. The pharyngeal bulb is long, with two long, narrow, rod-shaped macroplacoids; a microplacoid and septulum are absent. The claws are well developed with main branches provided with accessory points, and at the base of the claws, a structure interpretable as a very thin lunule is present. Other cuticular thickenings on the legs are absent.

J	Hoare, RJB; Patrick, BH; Buckley, TR				Hoare, Robert J. B.; Patrick, Brian H.; Buckley, Thomas R.			A new leaf-mining moth from New Zealand, Sabulopteryx botanica sp. nov. (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae, Gracillariinae), feeding on the rare endemic shrub Teucrium parvifolium (Lamiaceae), with a revised checklist of New Zealand Gracillariidae	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						New species; taxonomy; New Zealand; leaf miners; herbarium; checklist	GENUS; DNA; PHYLOGENY	Sabulopteryx botanica Hoare & Patrick, sp. nov. (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae, Gracillariinae) is described as a new species from New Zealand. It is regarded as endemic, and represents the first record of its genus from the southern hemisphere. Though diverging in some morphological features from previously described species, it is placed in genus Sabulopteryv Triberti, based on wing venation, abdominal characters, male and female genitalia and hostplant choice; this placement is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on the COI mitochondrial gene. The life history is described: the larva is an underside leaf-miner on the endemic divaricating shrub Teucrium parvifolium (Lamiaceae), and exits the mine to pupate in a cocoon in a folded leaf of the host plant. The remarkable history of the discovery and rediscovery of this moth is discussed: for many years it was only known from a single sap-feeding larva found in a leaf-mine in a pressed herbarium specimen of the host. The adult was discovered by BHP in Christchurch Botanic Gardens in 2013. Most distribution records of the moth come from a recent search for mines and cocoons on herbarium specimens of T. parvifolium. Sabulopterpc botanica has high conservation status, and is regarded as 'Nationally Vulnerable' according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation threat classification system, based on the rarity and declining status of its host plant. However, the presence of apparently thriving populations of S. botanica on cultivated plants of T. parvifolium, especially at the type locality, Christchurch Botanic Gardens, suggests that encouraging cultivation of the plant could greatly improve the conservation status of the moth. A revised checklist of New Zealand Gracillariidae is presented, assigning all species to the currently recognised subfamilies. The Australian Macarostola ida (Meyrick, 1880) is newly recorded from New Zealand (Auckland), where it is established on Eucalyptus.	[Hoare, Robert J.

The derived feature of Barathrieola is the sexually dimorphic third endopodal segment of leg 3 possessing a small outer terminal spine together with spine-like outgrowths on this segment. The new species differs from Barathricola rimensis Humes, 1999 in not expressing sexual dimorphism in leg 5, having three spines and one seta on its exopod in both sexes (B. rimensis has three spines and one seta on the female exopod but three spines and two setae on the male exopod) and in having broader caudal rami which are 8.9 times longer than wide in the female (this ratio for B. rimensis is 11).

The discovery of Neotropical Lepidosira (Collembola, Entomobryidae) and its systematic position	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						Caatinga; Entomobryomorpha; genome; integrative taxonomy; mitochondrial; phylogeny	BODY SCALES; NEW-WORLD; GENUS; WILLOWSIA; HEXAPODA; JANETSCHEKBRYA; PARONELLIDAE; ALIGNMENT; ISLANDS; RECORDS	We herein present the first reliable record of Lepidosira from Neotropical Region. Lepidosira neotropicalis sp. n. from Brazil is described and illustrated in detail, including its complete mitochondrial genome. We perform a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to place the new species within the Entomobryidae, and at the same time to test previous contrasting hypotheses on Lepidosira position within the Entomobryinae versus Seirinae for the first time. Phylogenetic analyses were based on one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I, 18S ribosomal RNA and 28S ribosomal RNA, respectively. Lepidosira neotropicalis sp. n. resembles L. sundana Yoshii and Suhardjono and L. nigropunctata (Nguyen) in dorsal chaetotaxy of abdominal segments I and II, but differs from all other species by the combination of head (dorsally and ventrally) and dorsal trunk chaetotaxy, plus empodial complex morphology. Our phylogenetic analyses support the placement of Lepidosira within Entomobryinae, as the sister group of Lepidocyrtoides. Overall, our revision enables a more objective diagnosis to Lepidosira and suggests that the genus is in need of a full revision due to its variable morphology, and lack of data needed to evaluate its monophyly. Finally, we provide an identification key for Neotropical genera of Entomobryinae.

In total, six species of Microhyla are documented, including M. berdmorei, M. heymonsi, M. butleri, M. mukhlesuri and two new species described from the semi-arid savanna-like plains of the middle part of the Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady) River Valley. We used a 2 481 bp long 12S rRNA - 16S rRNA fragment of mtDNA to hypothesize genealogical relationships within Microhyla. We applied an integrative taxonomic approach combining molecular, morphological, and acoustic lines of evidence to evaluate the taxonomic status of Myanmar Microhyla. We demonstrated that the newly discovered populations of Microhyla sp. from the Magway Division represent two yet undescribed species. These two new sympatric species are assigned to the M. achatina species group, with both adapted to the seasonally dry environments of the Irrawaddy Valley. Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. is a stout-bodied species with a remarkably enlarged shovel-like outer metatarsal tubercle used for burrowing and is highly divergent from other known congeners (P-distance >= 8.8%). Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. is a small-bodied slender frog reconstructed as a sister species to M. kodial from southern India (P-distance=5.3%); however, it clearly differs from the latter both in external morphology and advertisement call parameters. Microhyla mukhlesuri is reported from Myanmar for the first time. We further discuss the morphological diagnostics and biogeography of Microhyla species recorded in Myanmar.

The majority of revealed inter- and intrageneric relationships of these genera in both analyses were largely congruent except for the topology of Fungomyza and Arganthomyza being equivocal because of different topologies in phylograms generated by alternative molecular methods and Epischnomyia forming a branch within Anthomyza in the molecular data hypothesis. The formerly unsettled Anthomyza drachma proved to be the sister species of the A. umbrosa group while the affinity of A. flavosterna to the A. bellatrix group has not been confirmed. The first phylogenetic hypothesis of Anthomyzinae to include timing of the nodes of divergence is presented. The origin of the subfamily is dated into the Eocene, ca 37.5 (30.6-45.3) MYA, and agrees with the age of the oldest known fossils from Baltic amber. The analysed members of the Anthomyza group of genera were found to have already evolved in the upper Oligocene. The divergences of the Palaearctic and Nearctic sister species in Arganthomyza and Anthomyza were found to occur at several different times during the Neogene (upper Miocene) to lower Quaternary (Pleistocene), from about 7 to 0.7 MYA. These were likely the result of fragmentation of widespread (Holarctic or Sino-Japanese-Nearctic) ranges of ancestral taxa by vicariance events that were, in turn, caused by multiple interruptions of Beringia Land Bridges or cooling of climate and seem to be consistent with the times of multiple disjunctions of the flora.

Genetic delimitation of Pristimantis orestes (Lynch, 1979) and P. saturninoi Brito et al., 2017 and description of two new terrestrial frogs from the Pristimantis orestes species group (Anura, Strabomantidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Andes; Ecuador; new species; P. cajanuma sp. nov.; P. quintanai sp. nov.	NORTHERN ANDES; AMPHIBIA; CRAUGASTORIDAE; DIVERSITY; ALIGNMENT; MULTIPLE; PATTERNS; ECUADOR	In the genus Pristimantis, species are often combined into taxonomic units called species groups. The taxonomy of these groups is frequently inaccurate due to the absence of genetic data from type series and repeated misidentifications generated by high morphological resemblance between taxa. Here, we focus on the P. orestes species group, providing the first genetic assessment of P. orestes sensu stricto from individuals collected from the type locality, with a reviewed diagnosis and description of advertisement calls. We find that two lineages previously named P. orestes are genetically distinct and should be separated into two different species. Based on genetic and morphological data, we name one of these species P. cajanuma sp. nov. This new species is morphologically distinct from other members of the group by having shagreen dorsal skin, evident dorsolateral folds, broader discs on toes and fingers and pale gray ventral coloration. Additionally, P. saturninoi is placed within the P. orestes species group based on genetic data from its type series. However, we find that one of its paratypes is genetically distinct and belongs to a clade containing a new species we name P. quintanai sp. nov. This new species is morphologically distinguished by lacking a tympanic membrane and vocal sacs in males, and by having expanded discs on toes and fingers, finely tuberculated dorsal skin and irregular white or cream spots in the groin and concealed surfaces of thighs. Our findings highlight the importance of providing genetic characterization and placement from the type series in taxonomic challenging groups, such as Pristimantis. We also suggest that the diversity of species within the P. orestes group will increase as more sampling is achieved in the southern Andes of Ecuador.

These two species were each described from only one specimen that are separated from each other by 1,250 kilometres in southern Asia, where they occur in northeast India and central Lao PDR respectively. In 2017 and 2018, two specimens of Biswamoyopterus were discovered from Mount Gaoligong, west Yunnan province, southwest China (between the type locality of the two recognized species). This study aimed to evaluate the taxonomic status of these two newly acquired specimens of Biswamoyopterus by comparing their morphology with the two described species of the genus. The results of this study showed that the specimens from Yunnan province (China) differed from both B. laoensis and B. biswasi in both pelage colour and craniology, and should be recognised as a distinct species, B. gaoligongensis sp. nov., which is formally described here. This study contributes to the understanding of the flying squirrels of southern Asia and identifies an additional species that appears to be endemic to southwest China; however, more research is required to provide details of its ecology, distribution, and conservation status.

The systematic status of this taxon has remained questionable since its initial descriptions in the mid-1800s. A detailed molecular and morphological study was carried out to assess the validity of this genus, and its systematic position within the Asian agamid subfamily, Draconinae. Freshly collected and historical museum specimens from the type locality of O. paulus were examined morphologically, along with additional samples collected from localities in Mizoram state, Northeast India. Utilising newly generated molecular sequences (two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes), combined with those previously published for representative genera from the subfamilies Draconinae and Agaminae, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic trees were constructed. Phylogenetic results suggest that Oriocalotes is part of the widespread South and Southeast Asian radiation of Calotes. Comparative morphological studies (including external morphology, hemipenis and osteology) between Oriocalotes and related genera further support this systematic placement. Oriocalotes is herein regarded as a junior subjective synonym of Calotes. Calotes paulus comb. nov. is also assigned a lectotype and given a detailed redescription based on the lectotype, paralectotypes and additional topotypic material. Furthermore, the specimens collected from Mizoram populations are found to be morphologically and genetically distinct from Calotes paulus comb. nov., and are described herein as a new species, Calotes zolaiking sp. nov.

SP DIGENEA; PROTOZOA-MYXOSPORIDA; DEVELOPMENTAL-STAGES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; SP-NOV; FISHES; PLAGIOPORINAE; TREMATODES; MANTER	Podocotyle pearsei Manter, 1934 is documented from the intestine of Vaillant's grenadier, Bathygadus melanobranchus Vaillant (Macrouridae: Bathygadinae), collected from the northeastern and western Gulf of Mexico from 783-841 m depth. The finding of P. pearsei in B. melanobranchus represents the first originally published report of this genus from this host and the fifth documented host species for P. pearsei. We report three unidentified species of Podocotyle, represented by one individual each, from the intestine of the western Atlantic grenadier, Nezumia atlantica (Parr) (Macrouridae: Macrourinae), and from Bathygadus favosus Goode & Bean (Macrouridae: Bathygadinae) found at 637 m, 710 m and 1,143 m depths in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida and from the Caribbean Sea off Colombia. We provide a checklist of the parasites known from the three macrourid species relevant to this study, comment on the biogeography of the five species of Podocotyle now known from the deep sea and discuss the low host specificity observed across this genus. The high number of fish hosts for Podocotyle (i.e. type hosts include at least 22 piscine families) encompassing a wide phylogenetic diversity and diet makes it unlikely that members of a single genus could evolve such a broad array of life histories (i.e. utilize dissimilar intermediate hosts), and we predict in the future that Podocotyle will be taxonomically divided up. Morphological and especially molecular work is needed for Podocotyle as well as for other digenean genera known to inhabit the deep sea. Podocotyle sp. 1 & 2 represent the first originally published reports of this genus from N. atlantica while Podocotyle sp. 3 represents the first report of this genus from B. favosus. Podocotyle koshari Nagaty, 1973 is declared a species inquirenda, and a dichotomous key to the 27 species of Podocotyle we recognize is provided.

Morphologically, this new species is characterized by very small body size, cuticle with narrow annuli (0.8-0.9 mu m wide at mid-body), lateral field with two lines, originating at the level of the median pharyngeal bulb valve, straight amphidial apertures (similar to members of the subgenus Telomalenchus), sunken vulva with large lateral flaps, prophasmids located almost level with to 9 annuli posterior to the vulva in females, and undeveloped adanal bursa which can be considered as an outgrowth of the lateral field in males. Malenchus gilanensis n. sp. resembles members of subgenus Telomalenchus due to the straight amphidial apertures, prophasmid position and large lateral flaps, but it differs by having two lines in the lateral fields. This new species is morphologically similar to five known species of the subgenus Malenchus: M. acarayensis, M. bryanti, M. parvus, M. nanellus and M. truncatus.

J	Tachp, T; Huang, YZ				Tachp, Takuji; Huang, Yu-Zen			A new species of Medinodexia Townsend (Diptera: Tachinidae) from Japan, with a discussion on phylogenetic implications of the female postabdomen in Blondeliini	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Aulacophora nigripennis; Chrysomelidae; host; parasitoid; piercing-type ovipositor		Medinodexia japonica sp. nov. is described from Japan and an adult leaf beetle, Aulacophora nigripennis Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is recorded as its host. A piercing-type ovipositor is one of the characteristics of the genus Medinodexia Townsend, but it is also found in other blondeliine genera. To evaluate the structural differences of the piercing-type ovipositor, the female postabdominal characters were examined within Blondeliini and their phylogenetic implications are briefly discussed. Females of Medinodexia are similar to those of Medina Robineau-Desvoidy for the presence of invaginations on tergite 6 and sternite 6 of the abdomen. Medinodexia exigua Shima and M. orientalis Shima are not treated here, because they are considered to belong to an undescribed genus due to differences in the male and female postabdominal characters distinguishing them from the remaining species of Medinodexia.

This lineage is morphologically distinguished from other click-beetle subfamilies by the strongly protruding frontoclypeal region, which is longitudinally carinate medially, the pretarsal claws without basal setae, the hind wing venation with a well-defined wedge cell, the abdomen with seven (male) or six (female) ventrites, the large luminous organ on the abdominal sternite II, and the male genitalia with median lobe much shorter than parameres, and parameres arcuate, with the inner margin near its apical third dentate. Molecular phylogeny based on the combined 14 mitochondrial and two nuclear genes supports the placement of this taxon far from other luminescent click-beetle groups, which provides additional evidence for the multiple origin of bioluminescence in Elateridae. Illustrations of habitus and main diagnostic features of S. schimmeli Bi & Li, gen. et sp. nov. are provided, as well as the brief description of its luminescent behavior.

Delimitation and description of three new species of Himalopsyche (Trichoptera: Rhyacophilidae) from the Hengduan Mountains, China	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						caddisfly; freshwater; Himalaya; mountain; Sichuan; STACEY; stream; taxonomy; Yunnan	BIODIVERSITY	Three new species of the genus Himalopsyche (Trichoptera, Rhyacophilidae) from the Hengduan Mountains in China are described. Species delimitation was based on diagnostic features of genitalia, as well as molecular data from six genes analysed using the multi-species coalescent method STACEY. Formal descriptions are focused on genital morphology. Males of Himalopsyche viteceki sp. nov. are most similar to those of H. alticola and H. martynovi, and females are most similar to those of H. tibetana and H. velata. Himalopsyche immodesta sp. nov. is described based on a single male specimen and it most resembles the males of H. viteceki. Males of H. velata sp. nov. are most similar to H. tibetana, and females are most similar to those of H. maxima and H. tibetana. Diagnostic characters are found on segment IX and the superior and inferior appendages of male genitalia, and most notably on segment VIII in female genitalia. The newly discovered species underline the Hengduan Mountains as a potential source of yet undiscovered aquatic biodiversity.

Multivariate and univariate analyses of continuous and discrete morphological and color pattern characters statistically and discretely diagnose each lineage from one another and together, with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, provide the foundation for the recognition of each lineage as a new species-hypotheses corroborated with a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent species delimitation analysis. Ptychozoon cicakterbang sp. nov. ranges throughout Peninsular Malaysia to Pulau Natuna Besar, Indonesia; P. kabkaebin sp. nov. is endemic to northern and central Laos; and R tokehos sp. nov. ranges from southern Thailand south of the Isthmus of Kra northward to Chiang Mai, fringing the Chao Phraya. Basin and ranging southward through Cambodia to southern Vietnam. Ptychozoon lionotum sensu stricto ranges from northwestern Laos through southern Myarnnar to eastern India. The phylogeographic structure within each species varies considerably with R lionotum s.s. showing no genetic divergence across its 1,100 km range compared to P. cicakterbang sp. nov. showing upwards of 8.2% sequence divergence between syntopic individuals. Significant phylogeographic structure exists within R tokehos sp. nov. and increased sampling throughout Thailand may require additional taxonomic changes within this species.	[Grismer, L.

The latter is a leaf miner of Asteraceae, while A. ochrimaculosa is trophically associated with Malvaceae. Astrotischeria colombiana is known only from Colombia, but A. ochrimaculosa is more widely distributed from Colombia to Peru. The new species are illustrated with photographs of their habitats, adults, male and female genitalia, and leaf mines. We comment on the rarity of tischeriids in collections and their current known distribution in the Neotropics.

(Diptera, Stratiomyidae), and a potential threat to mass production of the fly as a feed supplement for domestic animals	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Morphology; new parasitoid; Dirhininae; synonym; hosts; threat; feed supplement; black soldier fly; Kenya; Ghana	BLACK SOLDIER FLY; LARVAE; WASPS; MANAGEMENT	Eniacomorpha hermetiae Delvare sp. n. (Hymenoptera, Chalcididae, Dirhininae), reared from pupae of black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens (Linnaeus, 1758) (Diptera, Stratiomyidae), is described and illustrated from Africa and compared with other similar species newly considered as forming the ehrhorni species-group within Eniacomorpha Girault, 1915. The newly described parasitic wasp may have a negative impact on efforts to mass produce BSF in Africa as a feed supplement for domestic animals. Eniacomorpha is removed from synonymy under Dirhinus Dalman, 1818, revised status, for the Afrotropical species of Dirhininae previously placed in Dirhinus subgenus Pareniaca Crawford, 1913. A checklist of the 10 recognized species of Afrotropical Eniacomorpha is given, of which 9 are new generic combinations.

Paraplehnia seisuiae sp. nov. is characterized by i) a developed muscular wall proximally occupying about one-third of the prostatic vesicle, ii) no common duct between the spermiducal bulbs and the prostatic vesicle, and iii) a genital pit between the male and female gonopores. We provide a partial sequence (712 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene as a DNA barcode for the species. Our phylogenetic analyses based on 603-bp 28S rDNA sequences indicate that P. seisuiae sp. nov. is nested in a Glade consisting of stylochoid species along with unidentified species of Stylochus. It suggests that Plehniidae belongs to Stylochoidea, although this should be confirmed by future studies that contain Plehnia arctica (Plehn, 1896), the type species of the type genus of the family. The interfamily relationship among the superfamily Stylochoidea remains poorly resolved.

The only species known from New Zealand prior to this study, P. tylotaster Dendy 1924, is re-examined and re-described from the holotype, using new scanning electron microscope images. Nine new species are described from New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone: P. mollis sp. nov., P. aureus sp. nov., P. vermiculatus sp. nov., P. kermadecensis sp. nov., P. turmericolor, sp. nov., P. deformis sp. nov., P. okokewae sp. nov., P. orbis sp. nov., and P. astronavis sp. nov. A specimen of P. schulzei (Dendy 1905), first described from Sri Lanka and subsequently recorded from New Caledonia, was also found in New Zealand, extending the range of this species. This study brings the total New Zealand Penares fauna to 11 species, making a significant contribution to the now, global total of 39 species. All previously described Penares species are reviewed based on their published descriptions, and species names have been corrected to their masculine form. Based on the published description of P. obtusus Lendenfeld 1907, it is recommended that this species be reassigned to the genus Stelletta Schmidt 1862.

The new species, H. songoku sp. nov., is distinguished by gonopod solenophore with rounded lobuliform lamina medialis, and well-developed lamina lateralis with a densely setose area; tip of gonopod tuberculiform. H. namek sp. nov. is separated from its congeners by its gonopod femorite being short, parallel-sided, slightly constricted at the middle; tip of gonopod rounded; and lastly, H. saiyans sp. nov. is diagnosable by its gonopod femorite being long and enlarged distally, postfemoral region short, tip bilobuled. The relationship among Hylomus species from Vietnam was analyzed using a fragment of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene. The analysis supports the monophyly of the genus Hylomus. It is recommended that more Hylomus species be added in the analysis to better clarify the phylogenetic relationships in the genus.

Revision of Fauveliopsidae Hartman, 1971 (Annelida, Sedentaria)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Deep-sea species; taxonomy; genital papillae; genera; species	WATER AGGLUTINATED FORAMINIFERA; POLYCHAETOUS ANNELIDS; GENUS	Abyssal polychaetes are usually difficult to be identified because they are small, their body patterns differ from their shallow water relatives, their delicate bodies are often damaged during sampling and sieving, and their taxonomy is in need of revision. Members of the family Fauveliopsidae Hartman, 1971 are widespread in deep ocean basins and they follow the above statements. In this contribution, we present a revision of all available type and non-type material for the family. Our objective is to provide keys to identify genera and species, as well as standardized diagnoses, and illustrations for most species, excluding those described since 2011, or where type material was not available. One genus, Riseriopsis n. gen., is proposed and four species are newly described. The Fauveliopsidac now includes 24 species in three genera: Fauveliopsis McIntosh, 1922 (13 species), Laubieriopsis Petersen, 2000 (8 species), and Riseriopsis n. gen. (3 species). Fauveliopsis includes species usually living inside gastropod or scaphopod shells or foraminiferan tubes, Laubieriopsis and Riseriopsis include species commonly regarded as free living, although some species of the latter have very long bodies and have been found inside soft tubes. Fauveliopsis includes: F. adriatica Katzmann & Laubier, 1974, F. armata Fauchald & Hancock, 1981, F. brattegardi Fauchald, 1972a, F. brevipodus Hartman, 1971, F. challengeriae McIntosh, 1922, F. glabra (Hartman in Hartman & Barnard, 1960), F. jameoaquensis Nunez in Nuflez, Ocafla & Brito, 1997, F. levensteinae n. sp., F. magalhaesi n. sp., F. magna Fauchald & Hancock, 1981, F. olgae Hartmann-SchrOder, 1983, F. rugosa Fauchald, 1972b, and E. scabra Hartman & Fauchald, 1971. Laubieriopsis includes: L. arenicola (Riser, 1987), L. blakei n. sp., L. brevis (Hartman, 1965), L. cabiochi (Amoureux, 1982), L. fauchaldi (Katzmann & Laubier, 1974) n. comb., L. hartmanae (Levenstein, 1970) reinst., L. norvegica Zhadan & Atroshchenko, 2012, and L. petersenae Magalhies. Bailey-Brock & Rizzo, 2014. Riseriopsis includes: R. arabica (Hartman, 1976) n. comb., R. confusa (Thiel, Purschke & Boggemann, 2011) n. comb., and R. santosae n. sp.

Rainforest and cloud forest Scolytodes (Curculionidae, Scolytinae, Hexacolini) from the Arthropods of La Selva inventory in Costa Rica: new species, new synonymy, new records	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						bark beetles; biodiversity survey; taxonomy; transect; weevils	COLEOPTERA	Quantitative collecting efforts over the last several decades in Costa Rica have resulted in many new species of insects. The Arthropods of La Selva projects included collecting from a typical lowland Neotropical forest and up an altitudinal transect, and has provided many valuable samples of insects, spiders and mites potentially new to science. We describe 18 new species in the bark beetle genus Scolytodes Ferrari, 1867, 14 of which were collected during this project: S. angulus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. sufflatus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. squaw:Owns Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. comosus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. spatulatus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. seriatus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. profundus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. catinus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. fimbriatus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. sulcifrons Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. planifrons Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. porosus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. mundus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. call sus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. parvipilus Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. plena; Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., S. niger Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov., and S. simplex Jordal & Kirkendall, sp. nov. One species, Scolytodes minutissimus Schedl, 1952, is redescribed to match the holotype. We give new Costa Rica records for S. costabilis Wood, 1974, which is the correct name for S. obesus Wood, 1975 (syn. nov.). We report Costa Rica as a new country record for six species: Scolytodes clusiacolens Wood, 1967, S. crinalis Wood, 1978, S. culcitatus (Blandford, 1897), S. libidos Wood, 1978, S. reticulatus (Wood, 1961), and S. spadix (Blackman, 1943). From a closely related genus, we provide the first record for Central America (and only the second collection) of Pycnarthrum fulgidumWood, 1977.

Baltic amber from the mid-Eocene of northern Europe is one of the most important sources of insect fossils, but only two reliably placed omaliines have been described. Here, we provide a general overview of this subfamily in Baltic amber. In total, five new extinct species of four genera in three tribes are described and illustrated: Geodromicus balticus sp. nov. (Anthophagini), Eusphalerum kanti sp. nov. (Eusphalerini), Paraphlaeostiba morosa sp. nov., Plyllodrepa daedali sp. nov., and Ph. ieari sp. nov.(Omaliini). Additionally, we report on four species belonging to Eusphalerum, which remain unnamed, from the same amber deposit. The records of Eusphalerum include the first fossils of the tribe Eusphalerini, while that of Geodromicus may represent the second and the first definitive fossil record of the genus and tribe Anthophagini. Our discoveries highlight the unexpected palaeodiversity of Omaliinae in Baltic amber, further minforcing the coexistence of thermophilous and temperate-loving beetles in Baltic amber and potentially indicating wetland and riparian habitats of amber-producing forests.

LEPIDOPTERA; COMPLEX LEPIDOPTERA; STEPHENSIA STAINTON; MEYRICK LEPIDOPTERA; DITRYSIAN PHYLOGENY; TRAUGOTT-OLSEN; LIFE-HISTORY; GENUS; MICROLEPIDOPTERA	An annotated catalogue of world species of Elachistinae (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea: Elachistidae) is presented. The classification follows recent phylogenetic studies. Genera and the species within each genus are listed in alphabetical order. All family, genus and species-group names of Elachistinae published before 28 August 2018 are treated. Sixty-six genus-group names are listed, 60 of which are nomenclaturally available. In the classification followed in this catalogue the species are placed in 10 genera. There are 1016 nomenclaturally available and 106 unavailable species-group names. Of these, 805 names are currently considered to represent valid species. For each species the following data are given: the reference to the original publication and the page; type locality; deposition of the name-bearing types; in the genus Elachista, the taxonomic rank with the subgenus and the informal species group when applicable; distribution; larval host plants; references to essential illustrations, and remarks, when needed. Synonyms are listed under valid names; distribution with geographic area and country records, for Australia, Canada and U.S.A. territories, provinces and states are given; Russia is divided into subregions. Larval host plant records are listed with notes regarding uncertain records. When possible, original references that are considered trustworthy in later literature are given, as well as relevant literature references for illustrations for each species. Synonymies, incorrect subsequent spellings and misspellings are listed under each species with full reference. Alphabetical lists are given for subfamily and infra-generic groupings of species of the genus Elachista, to summarize the placement of each species in its subgenus and species group within the subgenera. 110 valid and one unavailable species-group names originally described to genera currently considered elachistines, but later removed, are listed. When known, their current identity is given. The following taxonomic changes are made: Elachista amseli (Parenti, 1981), a secondary junior homonym of E. amseli Rebel, 1933, is replaced with E. parentii nom. nov.; Hemiprosopa asiatica Sinev, 1998 = Elachista asiatica (Sinev, 1998) stat. nov., comb. nov.; E. bipunctella (Sinev & Sruoga, 1995), a junior secondary homonym of E. bipunctella Treitschke, 1833, is replaced as E. ochropunctosa Kaila, nom. nov.; Elachista cerusella f. juncta Dufrane, 1957 is raised as species-rank name Elachista juncta Dufrane, 1957 stat. nov., a synonym of E. maculicerusella Bruand; Svenssonia corsicana Tautel & Nel, 2010 is transferred to Elachista (Aphelosetia), comb. n.; E. cupreella Blanchard, 1852 is transferred to Perittia, comb. nov.; E. flammeaepennella Costa, 1836 is raised as valid species, stat. rev.; Illantis Meyrick, 1921 is considered a junior subjective synonym of Elachista, syn. nov.; I. picroleuca Meyrick, 1921 is transferred to Elachista, comb. nov.; E. kosteri Traugott-Olsen, 1995 = E. differens Parenti, 1978, syn. nov.; E. oritropha Bradley, 1965 = E. iriphaea (Meyrick, 1932), syn. nov.; Paraperittia Rebel, 1916 = Phaulernis Meyrick, 1895 (Epermeniidae) syn. nov.; P. uniformella Rebel, 1916 = Phaulernis dentella (Zeller, 1839), syn. nov.; and E. zernyi Hartig, 1941 = E. stelviella Amsel, 1932, syn. nov.

J	Madurell, T; Spencer Jones, M; Zabala, M				Madurell, Teresa; Spencer Jones, Mary; Zabala, Mikel			Revision of the Genus Schizoretepora (Bryozoa, Cheilostomatida) from the Atlantic-Mediterranean region	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Phidoloporidae; taxonomy		We examined the type specimens and historical collections holding puzzling Atlantic and Mediterranean material belonging to the genus Schizoretepora Gregory, 1893. We performed a detailed study of the colonial characters and re-describe the resulting species and those that have rarely been found or have poor original descriptions. As a result of this revision, nine species are found in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. Six of them are re-described and illustrated: S. aviculifera (Canu & Bassler, 1930), S. calveti d'Hondt, 1975, S. imperati (Busk, 1884), S. sp. nov.? (= S. imperati sensu O'Donoghue & de Watteville 1939) (in open nomenclature, specimen lacks ovicells), S. pungens (Canu & Bassler, 1928) and S. solanderia (Risso, 1826). For S. dentata (Calvet, 1931), no material remains; furthermore, S. hassi Harmelin, Bitar & Zibrowius, 2007 and S. serratimargo (Hincks, 1886) have recently been described and redescribed, respectively. This new arrangement attains a coherent geographical distribution: S. imperati seems restricted to the eastern Atlantic, S. dentata and S. calveti are deepwater species from Atlantic islands, S. pungens and S. aviculifera dwell on the African coasts of the Western Mediterranean, S. hassi and S. sp. nov.? (= S. imperati sensu O'Donogue & de Wateville 1939) are confined to the Eastern Mediterranean, and S. solanderia and S. serratimargo live on the European coasts of the Mediterranean.

Three new species of Colomastix Grube, 1861 (Amphipoda: Colomastigidea) from Todos-os-Santos Bay, northeastern Brazilian coast, with identification keys to Atlantic Ocean species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Taxonomy; Crustacea; Colomastigidae; SW Atlantic; Bahia state; Brazil	CRUSTACEA; GAMMARIDEA; GULF; SEA	Colomastigids are small, commensal marine amphipods distributed worldwide. Here we present descriptions of three new species of Colomastix Grube, 1861 from Todos-os-Santos Bay (Bahia state), and separately identification keys to males and females of all known Colomastix species from the Atlantic Ocean. Males of Colomastix iemanja sp. nov. can be distinguished from all others in the genus especially by the bifurcate apex of inner ramus of uropod 1, with highly asymmetric branches surrounded by a membranous-like structure. Males of Colomastix tubulosa sp. nov. can be distinguished from all others in the genus especially by the tube-like morphology of the apex of inner ramus of uropod 1, the morphology of the distalmost palmar process of gnathopod 2 and by the expanded inner ramus of uropod 2. Females of Colomastix iemanja sp. nov. and Colomastix tubulosa sp. nov. are the only species in the Atlantic with a pleated apex on dactylus of gnathopod 2, besides Colomastix trispinosa Silvany, Alves & Senna, 2019. Colomastix marielle sp. nov. can be distinguished from all other species in the genus by the elongate carpus of pereopod 5 of females and by the rudder-like morphology of the apex of inner ramus of uropod 1 of males. These three new species increase the number of Colomastix in the Atlantic from 18 to 21, and are amongst the first records of the suborder Colomastigidea Lowry & Myers, 2017 from Brazilian waters.
