J	Moritz, T; Straube, N; Neumann, D				Moritz, Timo; Straube, Nicolas; Neumann, Dirk			The Garra species (Cyprinidae) of the Main Nile basin with description of three new species	CYBIUM			English	Article						Cypriniformes; Ostariophysi; Africa; Nile River; New species	FISHES; TELEOSTEI; ETHIOPIA	Five Garra species are recognized for the Main Nile basin. Garra vinciguerrae is confirmed as valid species. Three species are new to science, Garra napata sp. nov., G. jamila sp. nov. and G. sannarensis sp. nov. A fourth species, Garra sp. "White Nile", is known from only a single museum specimen in rather poor condition. Garra napata sp. nov., described from the area of the first and fourth Nile cataract, and G. jamila sp. nov. described from the Atbara River at Khashm el Girba are distinguished from all other African Garra species by a scaleless area reaching beyond the dorsal fin insertion, reducing the number of scale rows between the dorsal fin origin and the lateral line to 1-2.5 in G. napata and 2-2.5 in G jamila (vs. 3 or more in all currently known African Garra species). Both species differ from each other in colouration and oral-disc morphology: the vividly coloured G. jamila has a well-developed disc [type C] with prominent free posterior flap and crenate upper lip. Garra napata is characterised by its intermediate [type B] disc with very small and poorly developed or even absent posterior flap and smooth surface on the upper lip. Garra sannarensis sp. nov., described from the Blue Nile at Sennar, differs from all other African species by the combination of the following characters: intermediate developed disc (type B), the absence of predorsal scales, scaleless chest, belly and postpelvic area, and 4-4.5 scale rows between lateral line and dorsal-fin origin. Garra sp. 'White Nile' differs from the other Nilotic species by its long barbels almost reaching each other, when folded medially (vs. Barbels much shorter). Mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI) support that all newly described species and G. vinciguerrae represent distinct lineages within the Main Nile basin. Based on our findings, we provide a key for the Garra species of the Main Nile basin.

This makes rearing and/or molecular data necessary to associate the heteromorphic instars. Most of the described species are known from either post larval instars or larva. Following a previous study on Palearctic Erythraeidae, in the present study the instar association was made through an integrative approach including rearing trials and molecular analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene with the Bayesian Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (bGMYC) algorithm for species delimitation. Two new cave dwelling Erythraeidae (Trombidiformes: Parasitengona) species am described Lasioerythraeus jessicae sp. nov. and Leptus sidorchukae sp. nov. including all active instars.

These species are unique in Eutarsopolipus by having large hook-like unguinal setae on tarsi II-III. All species differ by only a few minor features, and the geographically isolated populations of E verberatus could not be distinguished reliably. Surprisingly, the presence/absence of leg I claws and seta v '' on femur I, which have been used to create species groups, is intraspecifically variable. Species delimitation and the tarsal setation of Podapolipidae, particularly Eutarsopolipus, are also discussed.

Here, we integrated molecular and morphological data for delimiting species boundaries and understanding the evolutionary history of the genus Potamometra. Twenty-seven complete mitochondrial genomes of Potamometra were sequenced, with samples representing most of the known geographically distributed locations around the Sichuan Basin. The results of different species delimitation methods (ABGD, bPTP, GMYC and BPP) based on the monolocus or multilocus data strongly supported the existence of two cryptic new species (Potamometra anderseni Zheng, Ye & Bu, sp. nov. and Potamometra zhengi Zheng, Ye & Bu, sp. nov.) although more entities were found in the tree-based delimitation methods. The two new species were successfully validated using morphological characters within a detailed taxonomic framework. Phylogenetic analyses supported the reciprocal monophyly of the seven highly node-supported clades, which were matched with the five known species and two new taxa. A novel gene arrangement pattern that two trnF (trnF1 and trnF2) genes separated by an intergenic spacer (IGS) were found in all the species except the sister group of Potamometra berezowskii Bianchi, 1896 and Potamometra linnavuorii Chen, Nieser & Bu, 2016. This gene rearrangement event could be explained by the tandem duplication and random loss (TDRL) model. Our study emphasized that the combination of molecular sequence data, morphological characters and mitochondrial structural information could improve the accuracy of species delimitation.

The Malay Archipelago comprises countries located in the maritime area of Southeast Asia between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, viz., Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, East Timor and the Philippines. Information compiled for each species includes references to the original description, subsequent re-combinations of specific name with other genera, and junior synonyms, if any, as well as the type locality, type habitat, later recorded habitats, and geographic distribution within and outside the Malay Archipelago. A historical review of explorations and taxonomic studies on oribatids in the various countries is also provided. A total of 1,030 valid species including subspecies and 6 doubtful species have been recorded from the Malay Archipelago from 1905 to 2018. The valid species belong to 323 genera, 98 families and 34 superfamilies in all of the five infraorders and two hyporders of the Suborder Oribatida. Among the component countries, the Philippines has the highest number of records at 513, followed by Indonesia including Kalimantan and excluding the Moluccas and Irian Barat on New Guinea Island (402), Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak (250), Brunei (64), and Singapore (28), while not a single species is currently known from East Timor. Most of the species known from Malaysia come from its two provinces (Sabah and Sarawak) in Borneo Island with 190, or more than twice that on Peninsular or West Malaysia with 77 species. On the whole, Borneo Island which is home for three countries has 235 recorded species with Sabah and Sarawak having 190, Brunei 64, and Kalimantan only 18 species. Aside from Borneo, the better explored islands, in descending order of records, are Luzon (346), Java (261), Samar (182), Mindanao (178), Leyte (112), Polillo (105), Bali (99), and Sumatra (82), and the peninsular part of Malaysia (78), while the relatively large island of Sulawesi has only 13 species records. Endemism to the individual countries ranges from 36.1-60.7%, the highest of which are Singapore (60.7%) and Brunei (57.8%). The relatively better known and bigger countries have lower rates of endemism-47.4% for the Philippines, 46.8% for Malaysia, whereas Indonesia, with the largest land area and earliest records, has the lowest rate of 36.1%. Overall, 608 species or 59.0% of the total fauna of the Malay Archipelago are known so far only from this region.

Altogether, 645 morphospecies from 56 families have been recognised from the Archipelago, of which 516 species (one with an additional two subspecies) were identified to the species level. Twenty-four, mostly widely distributed, species are recorded from the Socotra Archipelago for the fast time, and three species are newly recorded for the islands Abd el Kuri (1) and Samha (2). Lithocharis socotrana Assing, 2015 (Staphylinidae). described from Socotra, is recorded from continental Yemen for the first time. Five incomplete or incorrect previous records are corrected. A total of 305 (47%) of all recorded species are considered to be endemic to the Socotra Archipelago. A total of 62 (10%) species are widely distributed Afrotropical species, and 35 (5.5%) East African species, often reaching also the Arabian Peninsula; 16 (2.5%) species occur in the eremial zone of Sahara-Arabian (or Saharo-Sindian) region. Only 14 (2%) species were previously known solely from the Arabian Peninsula; 30 (4.5%) species have cosmopolitan (and often anthropogenic) distributions; 28 (4.5%) species are widely distributed in (sub)tropical areas of the Old World; and 26 (4%) species have a predominantly western Palaearctic distribution. At present, 129 (20%) morphospecies remain unidentified; however, we expect that many of them represent as yet undescribed taxa endemic to the Archipelago.

Two new species of Cephalophoxoides Gurjanova, 1977 (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Phoxocephalidae) from southeastern Brazil, with comments on the taxonomic status of the genus	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Amphipoda; Brazil; new species; taxonomy; Rio de Janeiro; Sao Paulo	CATALOG	Two new species of the genus Cephalophoxoides Gurjanova, 1977 are described. The material examined was collected during the Mini Biological Trawl (MBT) project, off Brazil's southeastern coast on the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, at depths ranging from 34 to 75 meters. Cephalophoxoides fortisetus sp. nov. resembles C. homilis (Barnard, 1960) in some general aspects of mandible, propodus of gnathopods 1-2, basis of pereopod 5 and rami of uropod 1. However, it can be distinguished by the latter species mainly by distinct characters on the maxilliped, gnathopod 1, uropod 2 and uropod 3. Also, the new species presents 1 short and 2 long stout setae on the lobes of telson as a notable character. Cephalophoxoides obtusimanus sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by presenting gnathopod 1 with an obtuse and weakly chelate palm as an exclusive character of the genus. An identification key for all species of Cephalophoxoides of the world is provided.

Females of A. chubudaigaku n. sp. are similar to A. costaricensis Carreno & Tuhela, 2011 by the position of the nerve ring at level of the first third of the isthmus, the body length and the comparative measurements of the oesophagus and tail. They differ by the position of the excretory pore and the vulva. The males of A. chubudaigaku n. sp. are characterized by the absence of ornamentations in the cervical cuticle and the nerve ring located at the posterior third of the corpus. In addition, the males of the new species can be differentiated by the length of the body and the comparative lengths of the oesophagus and the tail. The phylogeny of A. chubudaigaku n. sp. is inferred by the D2-D3 domains of the LSU rDNA and the validity of the genus Aoruroides Travassos & Kloss, 1958 is discussed on the basis of both molecular and morphological data. This constitutes the first species of the genus Aoruroides described from the Japanese archipelago.

Our phy logenies generated with genomic data provide strong support that the two new species are successive sisters to two described taxa, A. rubriventris and A. altamazonica, and collectively comprise the Ameerega rubriventris complex. The first new taxon, Ameerega panguana sp. nov., can be distinguished from all other Ameerega by its combination of a unique white venter and an advertisement call of 1-2 notes per second. The second new taxon, Ameerega imasmari sp. nov., is the only cryptically colored Ameerega species that is disttributed across the Fitzcarrald Arch in Southern Peru which possesses a 'peep' advertisement call consisting of 3-4 notes per second and a dominant frequency of 4.3-4.5 kHz. Within the Ameerega rubriventris complex, we observed differences between species in their ventral coloration, tympanum diameter, and call, which suggest that these taxa are reproductively isolated from each other.

(Scorpaeniformes: Liparidae) and Eumicrotremus fedorovi Mandrytsa, 1991 (Scorpaeniformes: Cyclopteridae), caught in the Simushir Island area of the North Pacific. This species differs from six previously known congeners by the following combination of features: the excretory vesicle reaches to the anterior edge of the ventral sucker, uterus pretesticular, genital pore prebifurcal and median, and testes entire or with irregular outline, occasionally distinctly lobate. Phylogenetic analysis of 28S rRNA gene partial sequences suggests a sister position of Caudotestis Issaitschikov, 1928 to the genus Biospeedotrema Bray, Waeschenbach, Dyal, Littlewood, & Morand, 2014, and unites C. dobrovolski n. sp. + Biospeedotrema spp. with Zdzitowieckitrema incognitum Sokolov, Lebedeva, Gordeev, & Khasanov, 2019. The phylogenetic relationship of Biospeedotrema and Zdzitowieckitrema Sokolov, Lebedeva, Gordeev, & Khasanov, 2019 with respect to the Opecoelidae is currently uncertain and, within the Xiphidiata, these genera are currently without adequate familial classification. However, Caudotestis belongs to the Stenakrinae, a subfamily within the Opecoelidae.

Paleogene Verrucidae (Cirripedia: Verrucomorpha) of North America, with descriptions of three new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Crustacea; Cirripcdia; Verrucomorpha; Verruca; Eocene; North America	WESTERN WASHINGTON-STATE; LINCOLN CREEK FORMATION; CRESCENT FORMATION; BLACK-HILLS; DOTY HILLS; EOCENE; THORACICA; BARNACLE; PACIFIC; GASTROPODA	In North America, Paleogene Verrucidae are rarely encountered. Only a single named species has been previously discussed by Zullo & Baum (1979), who provisionally assigned a Palaeocene form from North Carolina to Verruca rocana Steinmann, 1921. Eocene deposits in Washington State (USA) have now yielded two new species from intertidal to shallow water enviromnents: Verruca gailgoederlae sp. nov. from the middle Eocene Crescent/McIntosh transition zone, and Verruca sorrellae sp. nov. from the upper Eocene to lowest Oligocene Gries Ranch and basal Lincoln Creek formations. Both species are characterized by punctate shell plates, and are placed in the lineage of Verruca stroemia (O.F. Midler, 1776). In Alabama, marls from the upper Yazoo Formation (Pachuta and Shubuta Members) have yielded Verruca alabamensis sp. nov., an uncommon deeper water form associated with abundant brachiopods and phosphate deposition. This last species shows no development of punctac and is not related to the lineage that leads directly to Verruca stroemia.

However, the Macrostomum community has run into a roadblock following the discovery of an unusual genome organization in M. lignano, which could now impair the development of additional resources and tools. Briefly, M. lignano has undergone a whole-genome duplication, followed by rediploidization into a 2n = 8 karyotype (distinct from the canonical 2n = 6 karyotype in the genus). Although this karyotype appears visually diploid, it is in fact a hidden tetraploid (with rarer 2n = 9 and 2n = 10 individuals being pentaploid and hexaploid, respectively). Here, we report on a phylogenetically informed search for close relatives of M. lignano, aimed at uncovering alternative Macrostomum models with the canonical karyotype and a simple genome organization. We taxonomically describe three new species: the first, Macrostomum janickei n. sp., is the closest known relative of M. lignano and shares its derived genome organization; the second, Macrostomum mirumnovem n. sp., has an even more unusual genome organization, with a highly variable karyotype based on a 2n = 9 base pattern; and the third, Macrostomum cliftonensis n. sp., does not only show the canonical 2n = 6 karyotype, but also performs well under standard laboratory culture conditions and fulfills many other requirements. M. cliftonensis is a viable candidate for replacing M. lignano as the primary Macrostomum model, being outcrossing and having an estimated haploid genome size of only 231 Mbp.

SP; ELASMOBRANCHS	Male adults of gnathiid isopods (Crustacea; Isopoda; Gnathiidae) have remarkably developed rectangular-shaped cephalosomes and mandibles in most species. Tenerognathia visus Tanaka, 2005 belongs to a monospecific genus having remarkable characters in male morphology; reduced mandibles and large eyes occupying the whole of an elliptical cephalosome. The original description of T. visus is based on male adult specimens from coral rubble. This study found adult males and their larvae of T. visus attracted by light. Furthermore, specimens of female adults were observed by laboratory rearing of praniza larvae. In this study, morphologies of larvae and female adults of T. visus are described and notes on mating behavior in a laboratory aquarium are provided.

Three New Species and Two New Records of Parasesarma De Man, 1895 (Crustacea: Brachyura: Sesarmidae) from Taiwan and the Philippines from Morphological and Molecular Evidence	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES			English	Article						COI; Taxonomy; New species; Parasesarma aurifrons; P. sanguimanus; P. gemmatum; P. obliquefrons; Morphology; Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I	DECAPODA; GENUS; CRAB; REDESCRIPTION; SYSTEMATICS; TAXONOMY	Three new coastal crabs, Parasesarma aurifrons n. sp., P. sanguimanus n. sp. and P. gemmatum n. sp. (Sesarmidae), are described from Taiwan and the Philippines. Parasesarma aurifrons is morphologically similar to P. ungulatum (H. Milne Edwards, 1853), P. liho Koller, Liu & Schubart, 2010, and P. obliquefrons (Rathbun, 1924); P. sanguimanus most closely resembles P. cricotus (Rahayu & Davie, 2002); and P. gemmatum is related to P. lenzii (De Man, 1895), but they can be distinguished by a suite of characters, including the structures of the chelipeds, gonopods and vulvae. The three new species are also supported by genetic data from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI). Two species, P. lenzii and P. dumacense (Rathbun, 1914), are also recorded from Taiwan for the first time. The poorly known P. obliquefrons (Rathbun, 1924) from Samoa is figured for the first time as part of the comparisons and its taxonomically important gonopod structures are illustrated.

Revision of the Australian bee fly genus Sisyromyia White, 1916 (Bombyliidae, Bombyliinae, Acrophthalmydini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Australia; Bombyliidae; Acrophthalmydini; new species; new combination	DIPTERA	We review Sisyromyia White (Bombyliidae, Bombyliinae), a remarkable Australian endemic bee fly genus, which includes 11 species, including six species we describe as new here: Sisyromyia albisquama sp. nov., Sisyromyia angustivitta sp. nov.. Sisyromyia elongata sp. nov., Sisyromyia maculipennis sp. nov., Sisyromyia umbra sp. nov., Sisyromyia vittata sp. nov. The genus can be easily distinguished from other Australian genera in the subfamily by having a one-segmented antennal flagellum, subapex of flagellum with some long hairs; a pale median stripe present on the abdomen consisting of dense, decumbent short scales, cell r5 open; cell br nearly as long as cell bm, crossvein m-m located on base of cell dm; crossvein m-m long, nearly as long as crossvein r-m. We also recognized one new synonym, and propose a new combination for Sisyromyia binghi Evenhuis. A key to species of Sisyromyia is provided, and we extensively illustrate their internal and external morphology.

The new species had been confused with Zhangixalus smaragdinus (Blyth, 1852) in the past. Zhangixalus pachvproctus sp. nov. can be distinguished from Z. smaragdinus morphologically by the protruding vent in adult males, large thick grey reticular mottles below the white stripe on flank, more oblique snout in profile and wider head, longer snout, greater internarial distance, larger tympanum and longer hindlimb. The new species can be distinguished from other species of Zhangixalus with green dorsum by the following combination of characters: body size larger (SVL of adult males: 74.2-83.3 mm; SVL of adult female: 102.4 mm); dorsum smooth; narrow white stripes along edge of the lower jaw, body sides, outer side of limbs and above the vent; absence of brown bands on canthus rostralis, upper eyelid and supratympanic fold; webbing between fingers and toes complete except between the first two fingers; and internal single subgular vocal sac. Phylogeny based on comparison of 16S rRNA sequences suggests that the new species is the sister taxon to Z. smaragdinus and the two species differ by 7.63% in the uncorrected pairwise distance of 16S sequences.

J	Li, X; Che, XJ; Zhou, W				Li, Xu; Che, Xing-Jin; Zhou, Wei			Loaches of Homatula (Teleostei: Nemacheilidae) from the upper Salween River in Yunnan, China with description of three new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Morphological comparison; taxonomy; new species; Cypriniformes	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; PYCNOLEPIS; DRAINAGE; NUCLEAR	Seven loaches of Homatula are distributed in a narrow geographical area between the upper Black River (or Song Da in Vietnam, that is a major tributary of the Red River, including the tributaries Lixian-jiang and Tengtiao-jiang in Yunnan, China) and the upper Salween River drainage (including tributaries of the Nu-Jiang and Nanding-he, the latter is a major tributary of the Salween River in Yunnan, China). These seven species are distinguished from other Homatula by the combination of having the body densely-scaled, the lateral line complete, and a short adipose crest along the dorsal midlinc of the caudal peduncle that does not mach the posterior end of anal-fin base or does not extend beyond the middle of the anal-fin base. Based on a comparison with the described species of the densely-scaled group of Homatula, we can confirm that the specimens collected from the Nu Jiang drainage in western Yunnan are different from known species and arc described herein as Homatula anteridorsalis sp. nov., Homatula cryptoclathrata sp. nov., and Homatula nigra sp. nov.

One genotype and morphotype were of the known species, Australatya striolata (McCulloch & McNeill 1923). The second genotype, comprising two morphotypes, is now described as a new species, Australatya hawkei sp. nov.. All Australian Australatya species and morphotypes currently have allopatric distributions. Australatya striolata is widespread along the south-eastern Australian seaboard. from Genoa River in Victoria to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. The 'southern' morphotype of Australatya hawkei sp. nov. occurs in north Queensland, from near Mackay to about Cooktown, and its 'northern' morphotype is found on Cape York Peninsula, north from about Coen to the Iron Range, just north of Lockhart River. The once monotypic genus now includes two Australian species, Australatya striolata and A. hawkei sp. nov., and a third, A. obscura, recently described from Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

Three new Brazilian species of the sharpshooter genus Amblyscarta Stal, 1869 and redescription of A. unilfasciata (Fabricius, 1803) comb. nov. (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Cicadellinae; leafhopper; morphology; Neotropics; taxonomy		Three new Brazilian species of the sharpshooter genus Amblyscarta Stal, 1869 are described and illustrated: A. elianeae sp. nov. (states of Parana and Minas Gerais), A. souzalopesi sp. nov. (State of Rio de Janeiro), and A. pinna sp. nov. (State of Mato Grosso). The first two species are from the Atlantic Forest, whereas the third is from the Amazon Forest. Cicada unifasciata Fabricius, 1803 is redescribed and transferred to Amblyscarta based on specimens from Guyana and northern Brazil (Amazon Forest). This Fabrician species is the type of the monobasic genus Strictogonia Melichar, 1926, which is thus considered a junior synonym of Amblyscarta. A diagnosis of Amblyscarta is added, as well as brief notes on the phenology of A. elianeae. This paper provides the first detailed descriptions and illustrations of the female terminalia of Amblyscarta species.

In Colombia, A. metica is the only species of the genus recorded so far, which was initially described with material collected in the Colombian Orinoquia and more recently recorded in the southeastern Brazil. In the present study, Ablabesmyia opita sp. n. from the Colombian Andes is described and illustrated based on adult males collected at the inter-andean valley of Magdalena river basin. In addition, an updated taxonomic key for Neotropical species and a map of Ablabesmyia records in Colombia are provided. The male of the new species is similar to that of A. laurindoi but can be easily distinguished by the coloration patterns of the legs, the shape of the sternapodeme and by the number of antepronotals.

The new species can be easily distinguished from the only other species of the genus, C. hyloraina Lindeman, 1990, by gnathopod 2 (carpus short, palm longer than wide), pereopod 4 dactylus with a denticulate patch, pereopod 5 basis ovate with a deep posterodistal lobe reaching the distal end of the ischium, pleopod 3 ramus with more than six articles. Cerrorchestia tabouleki sp. nov. is the first forest-hopper discovered in the Lesser Antilles, raising the question of island colonization by terrestrial amphipods. Ecological data and a key to terrestrial Talitridae of Central America and the Caribbean islands are provided.

J	Han, HY; Ro, KE				Han, Ho-Yeon; Ro, Kyung-Eui			DNA barcoding reveals a species group of the genus Campiglossa (Diptera, Tephritidae, Tephritinae) with recognition of a new species from East Asia and previously unknown females of Campiglossa coei (Hardy)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Campiglossa; Dioxyna; Homoeotricha; misella group; Tephritini	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE	While analyzing DNA barcodes of all the Korean and some East Asian tephritid species in conjunction with the barcode sequences available from BOLD Systems (www.boldsystems.org ), the large and taxonomically enigmatic genus Campiglossa was recovered as a monophyletic Glade, together with the genera Dioxyna and Homoeotricha, which are here synonymized for that reason. Ten major lineages are also recognized within the Campiglossa Glade: producta group, loewiana group, sororcula group, irrorata group, achyrophori group, difficilis group, luxorientis group, magniceps group, arisanica group, and misella group. Here, more detailed taxonomic accounts are provided for the misella group, including four DNA analysis-recovered members: C. cod, C. misella, C paramelaena sp. nov., and C. melaena. A single morphological synapomorphy is proposed for this species group: the presence of a large mid-anterior dark wing marking in males with associated structural modification (more apically positioned crossvein R-M than in females). Based on the morphological characteristics, two presumptive members that are only known from male specimens are further recognized: C. pishanica and C propria from China. A full description of C. paramelaena sp. nov., and a redescription of C. coei, for which only males were previously known, are provided. For all the included species, a taxonomic key, diagnoses, and photographs to aid their accurate identification are given. Finally, C. favillacea is synonym lied with C coei and C. roscida with C. misella, and C. coei and C. pishanica resurrected from the synonymy of C. misella.

Astromesitius, a new genus of Mesitiinae (Hymenoptera, Bethylidae) from the Old World	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						New genus; hypopygium; 'star-shaped'; new species; United Arab Emirates	SULCOMESITIUS-MOCZAR; MESITINAE; GENERA; MORPHOLOGY; GENITALIA	Literature about Mesitiinae Kieffer, 1914 has not been treated extensively from a taxonomic viewpoint in comparison with other subfamilies in Bethylidae Latreille, 1802. Our research on species of Metrionotus Moczar, 1970, Clytrovorus Nagy, 1972 and Sulcomesitius Moczar, 1970 revealed a new hypopygium shape pattern, namely a 'star-shaped' hypopygium, which is characteristic of a new genus, Astromesitius gen. nov., with two new species Astromesitius thionyi gen. et sp. nov. and Astromesitius olavoi gen. et sp. nov. The descriptions of both new species are based on male specimens collected in Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. Astromesitius quatei (Moczar, 1977) gen. et comb. nov. is designated as type species for the new genus, which is erected for a total of seven species. The main diagnostic characteristics are the head longer than wide; a clypeus with a median lobe quadrate; an antenna with distinct long setae, with pedicel caliciform, and with flagellomeres long and caliciform; pronotum and anteromesoscutum with longitudinal sulcus indistinct or absent; metapectal-propodeal complex with posterior projection hardly distinct or absent; hypopygium star-shaped; genitalia with aedeagus slender and fusiform.

J	Sharaf, MR; Aldawood, AS; Garcia, FH				Sharaf, Mostafa R.; Aldawood, Abdulrahman S.; Garcia, Francisco Hita			Review of the Arabian Crematogaster Lund (Hymenoptera, Formicidae), synoptic list, distribution, and description of two new species from Oman and Saudi Arabia	ZOOKEYS			English	Review						Arabian Peninsula; Asir Mountains; Dhofar Governorate; Middle East; new records; new species; new status; new synonymy; Qatar; taxonomy	ANTS; CHECKLIST; EVOLUTION; HERBIVORY; TAXONOMY	The genus Crematogaster is one of the most species-rich and widespread groups of ants. Despite their of-ten-high local abundance and important ecological interactions, the taxonomy of the genus is fragmentary and in great need of modern revisionary studies. As a first step towards a revision for the Arabian fauna of Crematogaster, a review of all known species with synoptic species accounts is provided. Seventeen species are recognized and illustrated from the Arabian Peninsula, of which two new species are described: C jacindae Sharaf & Hita Garcia, sp. nov. from the Dhofar Governorate, Oman, and C. gryllsi Sharaf & Hita Garcia, sp. nov. from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) based on the worker caste. Crematogaster jacindae sp. nov. is easily separated from the remainder of the Arabian Crematogaster fauna due to its complete lack of propodeal spines, slit-shaped propodeal spiracles, and its distinct bicoloration, whereas C. gryllsi sp. nov. is readily distinguished by its unlobed postpetiolar dorsum. Furthermore, new country records are presented: C. acaciae Ford for the KSA and Yemen, and C. delagoensis Ford and C. jehovae Ford for the KSA C. antaris for Qatar, whereas C. luctans Ford is excluded from the Arabian fauna. In addition, on the basis of morphological examination of original type material, C. affabilis Ford is proposed as junior synonym of C. chiarinii Mayr, and C. striaticeps is elevated to specks rank stat. nov. Furthermore, a new identification key for the Arabian species is provided, as well as distribution maps for all species.

Taxonomic revision of the genus Machleida Fahraeus, 1870 (Tenebrionidae, Pimeliinae, Asidini)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Afrasida; darkling beetles; female terminalia; new specics; Scotinesthes; synonyms; South Afric	COLEOPTERA; CLASSIFICATION	The taxonomic concept of the genus Machleida Fahraeus, 1870 is tested and revised based on newly identified material. The following new species are described: Machleida banachi, M. flagstaffensis, M. tarskii, and M. zofiae Kaminski. Machleida capillosa Wilke, 1925 is considered as a junior subjective synonym of Asida devia Peringuey, 1899. Asides lecta Peringuey, 1899 (= Pseudomachla recurva Wilke, 1925) (transferred to Afinsida), Machleida nossibiana Fairmaire, 1897 (transferred to Scotinesthes), and Machleida tuberosa Wilke, 1925 (interpreted as incertae sedis in Asidini) are excluded from Machleida. An identification key for the species of the newly revised Machleida is provided. The present paper brings the total number of species within the genus to six (M. banachi sp. nov.; M. devia (Peringuey, 1899): M. flagstafensis sp. nov.; M. nodulasa Fahraeus, 1870; M. tankii sp. nov.; M. zofiae Kaminski sp. nov.). The morphology of female terminalia (ovipositor and genital tubes) is described for the genus for the time.

The Tennessee Cavesnail, Antrorbis tennesseensis Perez, Shoobs, Gladstone, & Niemiller, sp. nov. is distinguished from its only known congener, Antrorbis breweri, by the absence of raised tubercles on its finely spirally striate protoconch, and its unique radular formula. Moreover, A. tennesseensis is genetically distinct from A. breweri based on substantial divergence at the mitochondrial CO1 locus. This is the first cavesnail to be described from the Appalachian Valley and Ridge (AVR) physiographic province in the state of Tennessee, which previously represented a substantial gap in the distribution of stygobitic (i.e., aquatic, subterranean-obligate) gastropods.

A key to all eight Orthomorpha species and two varieties known to occur in Vietnam is provided. Although the morphological characters that have been traditionally used for Orthomorpha taxonomy are here considered superior to molecular ones, molecular-based phylogenetic relationships and taxon assignments within the tribe Orthomorphini are provisionally analyzed using fragments of the cytochrome c oxidate subunit I (COD mitochondrial gene. The preferred phylograms, both rooted and unrooted, demonstrate the monophyly of the tribe Orthomorphini, but due to the special, uncertain or even controversial position of O. coarctata, which occurs closer to the genera Antheromorpha and Hylomus, the genus Orthomorpha in current usage appears to be polyphylctic. However, if O. coarctata is to be treated within the monotypic genus Asiomotpha, the monophyly of Orthomorpha becomes manifest. On the other hand, a cautious approach is followed to avoid descriptions of suspicious new taxa/species. Thus, solely because the average genetic distance between O. rodundicollis subrotundicollis var. nov. and O. rodundicollis, as well as that between O. scabra ranch; var. nov. and O. scabra, are both found to be negligibly small, the statuses of the sympatric and closest yet morphologically different varieties are treated only as such, i.e., infrasubspecific categories. The apparent discord observed between morphological and molecular data is obviously due to only partial and single-gene topologies used, possibly also to hybridization already known to occur in some closely related and sympatric paradoxosomatid species or even genera.

This taxonomic act is justified after detailed comparison of C. misti with representatives of phenotypically similar other South American Colias, including the subspecies of C. lesbia. The newly presented taxa are diagnosed by adult morphology, bionomics, and male genitalia. The diagnosis of a new subspecies Colias misti ccota Kir'yanov ssp. nov., discovered in the World's deepest canyon Cotahuasi (Peru), is based on different and stable characters in phenotypes, genitalia, and bionomics of C. misti ccota and C. misti misti. Both subspecies of C. misti are endemic to the Western slopes of the Andes. It is also demonstrated that the shape of the male aedeagus is diagnostic for a reliable identification of the South American Colias.

The new species is morphologically most similar to P. spinifera among other congeners, but it strongly differs from that species by having upper the antennular flagellum with 14-16 segments, short free ramus with 12-13 segments, lower antennal flagellum thin and bearing 35-37 segments; 4 minute lateral spines on basal segment of 3rd maxilliped; male palm:carpus ratio of second pereopod higher than in female, propodus of 3rd pereopod with 7-8 ventral spines and hepatic spine with groove. Genetic analysis using the mitochondrial COI and 16S rRNA genes sequences proved that, the new species is significantly distinct from the closed related species.

Recent studies have shown that it comprises multiple cryptic species and the nominal species is now restricted to southern Africa. Newly collected mitochondrial data (16S rRNA) helped to resolve the status of the Kenyan populations, which revealed the presence of two distant related species. Pairwise distances show average 5.87% differences between the two Kenyan species, and 3.58-5.27% and 8.62-9.15% to nominal P. wahlbergi and P. maculicollis Jacobsen & Broadley, 2000 respectively. Ablepharus massaiensis Angel, 1924 was described from the Maasai plains near Nairobi, but has long been considered a junior synonym of P. wahlbergi. We herein resurrect Panaspis massaiensis comb. nov. as a valid species and describe a new species, Panaspis tsavoensis sp. nov. from the Tsavo Conservation Area in south-eastern Kenya. Morphological examinations of specimens reveal minor differences from each other as well as nominal forms of P. wahlbergi and P. maculicollis. Panaspis massaiensis comb. nov. shares with the P. wahlbergi group a white ventrolateral stripe but can be distinguished by the presence of 26 midbody scale rows versus 24. Panaspis tsavoensis sp. nov. on the other hand, lacks the white ventrolateral stripe, most similar to the P. maculicollis group but differs in that P. maculicollis breeding males have a black patch on the neck with diagonal rows of white spots. Panaspis massaiensis comb. nov. is widespread in the Kenyan and northern Tanzanian highlands, isolated dryland montane forests and rocky hills, while P. tsavoensis sp. nov. occur in the expansive arid lowlands of Tsavo Conservation Area and should be present in similar arid lowlands in northern Kenya as well as in adjacent Tanzania.

Hence a survey was conducted from August 2015 to November 2018 in 11 localities of this region. In each locality, grasshoppers were sampled in three vegetation types (forests, fallows and cultivated farms) using sweep nets sampling method. We collected in total 51 short-horned grasshopper species belonging to the families Acrididae, Chorotypidae, Euschmidtiidae, Pyrgomorphidae and Thericleidae. Among these species, 43 belong to Acrididae, 5 to Pyrgomorphidae and only one belongs to the Chorotypidae, Euschmidtiidae and Thericleidae respectively. The Chorotypidae species Hemierianthus mbongueensis Yetchom & Xu sp.nov. is also described in this study. Twelve grasshopper species were widely distributed as they occurred in all study sites and 11 were recorded exclusively from one study site. This study showed that there is high species richness of short-horned grasshoppers in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. However, more sampling effort in different ecosystems of this region and other regions of Cameroon will certainly improve our understanding on grasshopper taxonomy, ecology and biogeography.

The genus Hebecnema Schnabl with description of a new Canarian endemic species and a review of the European fauna	ZOOTAXA			English	Review						Canary Islands; Madeira; Azores; taxonomy; ovipositor; endemism; new species	DIPTERA	An account is given on the three species of the muscid genus Hebecnema Schnabl occurring in the Macaronesian islands. These are Hebecnema anthracina Stein from Madeira, H. anthracinella sp. nov. from the western Canary Islands, and H. fumosa (Meigen) found in the Canary Islands, Madeira and Azores. Existing Macaronesian records of H. umbratica (Meigen) from the Azores and H. vespertina (Fallen) from the Canary Islands are based on misidentifications. Diagnoses of the European species with photos of the male terminalia and a key to species are given. It is pointed out that the two species of Muscidae recently described as new from Sweden, Mydaea forsslundi Zielke, 2017 and Hebecnema brodina Zielke, 2018, represent exotic species, probably of Oriental provenance. Finally, morphological differences in the female ovipositor divide the seven European species of Hebecnema in two species groups.

Stingless bees of the genus Nannotrigona Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) in Colombia	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Anthophila; Apoidea; diversity; meliponiculture; taxonomy		Nannotrigona Cockerell is one of the few stingless bee genera widely distributed and commonly encountered throughout the Neotropical region. Some species are abundant and managed in meliponiculture. However, the identity and number of species occurring in some countries or areas is almost entirely unknown. Herein we reviewed the species of Nannotrigona in Colombia, a South American country with literature records indicating the presence of either one or five species of this genus. Appraisal of museum specimens revealed the existence of the following eight species, three of which we describe as new: N. camargoi Rasmussen & Gonzalez, N. gaboi n. sp., N. melanocera (Schwarz), N. mellaria (Smith), N. occidentalis n. sp., N. pilosa n. sp., N. schultzei (Friese), and N. tristella (Cockerell). We describe and figure the male of N. camargoi, N. gaboi, N. melanocera, and N. pilosa. In addition, we provide comparative diagnoses, a key to species, and new geographical records.

GEN.; SYNCARIDA; MALACOSTRACA; DIVERSITY; EUMALACOSTRACA; SELECTION; MODELS; FAMILY; SP.	Bathynellidae is the neglected family of Bathynellacea, a groundwater group of crustaceans with 33 genera and 107 species described and almost half of them included in the 'catch-all' genus Bathynella. Due to the morphological homogeneity of the species, the taxonomic uncertainties have accumulated over time. Therefore, to explore the phylogenetic relationships among taxa, a combined approach using morphological and molecular data is needed. In this paper, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of COI and 18S including 30 species of Bathynellidae. This data set represents the most updated one, including a new genus and a new species (Altainella calcarata gen. n. sp. n.) of Bathynellidae described here from Altai Mountain (Russia). The new taxon presents a new type of sexual dimorphisms with a peculiar structure on the coxopod of the male thoracopod VII and also sexual dimorphism on the mandibular palp, as some species of the subfamily Gallobathynellinae. This is the first species of Bathynellidae that presents both variants of sexual dimorphism. The molecular phylogeny supports the morphology and the erection of the new genus and displays highly divergent genetic units corresponding to subfamilies, with the new genus closer to Bathynellinae genera than other subfamilies. With the description of this new species and its molecular characterization, the existence of the other genera beyond Bathynella is confirmed in Eurasia.

However, the taxonomic decision that should be made when convergence between the different lines of evidence is not observed remains debated. Here, we investigate the consequences of the application of an 'integration by cumulation' approach on the taxonomic statuses within the Bombus lapidarius complex when using an integrative taxonomic framework (i.e. nuclear and mitochondrial markers along with reproductive traits) compared with a strict 'integration by congruence' method. Our results show similar taxonomic conclusions whatever the decision-making approach used except for one taxon. According to the differentiation observed in our integrative taxonomic framework, recent divergence time and other field observations for this taxon, we assume that a too strict decision-making method could fail to detect recently diverged species. This is exemplified by the new species Bombus bisiculus sp. n. occurring in South Italy and Sicily.

The molecular analysis placed Eumida mackiei sp. nov. in a monophyletic clade with 19.1% (COI), 10.1% (ITS) and 1.7% (28S) mean distance to its nearest neighbour. Molecular diagnoses were also applied to nine lineages within the E. sanguinea complex. This was complemented with morphometric data employing multivariate statistical analysis and the incorporation of statistical dissimilarities against three other described species from the complex. Eumida mackiei sp. nov. can be distinguished from E. notata and E. maia by the larger distance between the eyes and differences in morphometric proportions mainly in the dorsal and ventral cirri as well as in the prostomial appendages. E. sanguinea sensu stricto failed to produce a cluster of its own in the morphometric analysis, probably due to juvenile bias. Integrative taxonomy provided strong evidence to formally describe a new cryptic species that can now be used in biomonitoring or other relevant ecological research.	[Teixeira, Marcos A.

Taxonomy and biostratigraphy of the elasmobranchs and bony fishes (Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes) of the lower-to-middle Eocene (Ypresian to Bartonian) Claiborne Group in Alabama, USA, including an analysis of otoliths	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Tallahatta Formation; Lisbon Formation; Gosport Sand; Gulf Coastal Plain; Elasmobranchii; Teleostei	GULF COASTAL-PLAIN; SELACHIAN FAUNA; SOUTH-CAROLINA; LISBON FORMATION; BRANCH FORMATION; UNITED-STATES; WHITE SHARK; FOSSIL; PALEOCENE; PHYLOGENY	The Tallahatta Formation, Lisbon Formation, and Gosport Sand are the three lithostratigraphic units that make up the lower-to-middle Eocene Claiborne Group. In Alabama, these marine units are among the most fossiliferous in the state and a long history of scattered reports have attempted to document their fossil diversity. In this study, we examined 20931 elasmobranch and bony fish elements, including otoliths, derived from Claiborne Group units in Alabama and identified 115 unequivocal taxa. Among the taxa identified, one new species is described, Carcharhinus mancinae sp. nov., and Pseudabdounia gen. nov. is a new genus erected to include two species formerly placed within Abdounia Capatta, 1980. New taxonomic combinations proposed include Pseudabdounia claibornensis (White, 1956) gen. et comb. nov., Pseudabdounia recticona (Winkler, 1874) gen. et comb. nov., Physogaleus alabamensis (Leriche, 1942) comb. nov., and Eutrichiurides plicidens (Arambourg, 1952) comb. nov. We also report the first North American paleobiogeographic occurrences of Aturobatis aff. A. aquensis Adnet, 2006, Brachycarcharias atlasi (Arambourg, 1952), Eutrichiurides plicidens comb. nov., Galeorhinus louisi Adnet & Cappetta, 2008, Ginglymostoma maroccanum Noubhani & Cappetta, 1997, Gymnosarda sp., Mennerotodus sp., Rhizoprionodon ganntourensis (Arambourg, 1952), Stenoscyllium aff. S. priemi Noubhani & Cappetta, 1997, Trichiurus oshosunensis White, 1926, and the first North American occurrence for a fossil member of the Balistidac Risso, 1810. Our sample also included 26 taxa that represented first paleobiogeographic occurrences forAlabama, including Abdounia beaugei (Arambourg, 1935), Albula eppsi White, 1931, Ariosoma nonsector Nolf & Stringer, 2003, Anisotremus? sp., Anomotodon sp., Brachycarcharias twiggsensis (Case, 1981), Burnhamia daviesi (Woodward, 1889), Eoplinthicus yazooensis Capetta & Stringer, 2002, Galeorhinus ypresiensis (Casier, 1946), Gnathophis meridies (Frizzell & Lamber, 1962), Haemulon? obliquus (Muller, 1999), Hypolophodon sylvestris (White, 1931), Malacanthus? sulcatus (Koken, 1888), Meridiania cf. M. convexa Case, 1994, Palaeocybium proosti (Storms, 1897), Paraconger sector (Koken, 1888), Paralbula aff.

A biostratigraphic analysis of our sample showed stratigraphic range extensions for several taxa, including the first Bartonian occurrences of Eoplinthicus yazooensis, Jacquhermania duponti (Winkler, 1876), Meridiania cf. M. convexa, Phyllodus toliapicus, and "Rhinobatos" bruxelliensis (Jaekel, 1894), range extensions into the late Ypresian and Bartonian for Tethylamna dunni Cappetta & Case, 2016 and Scoliodon conecuhensis Cappetta & Case, 2016, the first late Ypresian records of Galeorhinus louisi, the first Lutetian occurrence of Gymnosarda Gill, 1862, and a range extension for Fisherichthys aff. F. folmeri Weems, 1999 into the middle Bartonian. Larger biostratigraphic and evolutionary trends are also documented, such as the acquisition of serrations in Otodus spp. , possible population increases for the Rhinopterinae Jordan & Evermann, 1896 and Carcharhiniformes Compagno, 1973 in the Bartonian, and the apparent diversification of the Tetraodontiformes Berg, 1940 during the same stage. This study helps better our understanding of earlyto-middle Eocene elasmobranch and bony fish diversity, paleobiogeography, and biostratigraphy in the Gulf Coastal Plain of North America.

The type species, C. artificiosus, has been assumed to be widely distributed throughout the Indo-West Pacific and a fourth species, C. conchifera (Haswell, 1882), from Australia, has been regarded as a synonym. The enigmatic and long overlooked "Caphyra pectenicola Adams, in Belcher, 1848" is shown to be a species of Conchoecetes occurring in Java, Singapore and the Gulf of Thailand We review the status of these species, establish C. conchifera as a valid species, and describe five new species: C. atlas n. sp., C avikele n. sp., C. chanty n. sp., C. investigator n. sp. and C. pembawa n. sp. In this revision we recognize 10 valid species in Conchoecetes. They are distributed from Southern Africa, across the Indian Ocean to Australia and northwards to China Formerly considered to be cosmopolitan, C. artificiosus is restricted to India, Sri Lanka Pakistan, as well as the Persian Gulf and Madagascar, while C. intermedius, first discovered near Madagascar, is shown to be the most widespread species occurring from Africa to China.

The genus is characterised by the presence of lanceolate scales, the subapical chaeta of the maxillary outer lobe thick and blunt, dental spines absent and a short mucro. In this paper we describe four new species of Plumachaetas from Oceania: P. belae sp. nov., P. loriensis sp. nov., P. mamuensis sp. nov. and P. wanangensis sp. nov. Plumachaetas belae sp. nov. and P. mamuensis sp. nov. are similar to each other, and to P. queenslandica (Schott) and P. yoshii Zhang & Deharveng, but are unique in the combination of dorsal and labial chaetotaxy. Plumachaetas loriensis sp. nov. resembles P. halmaherae (Yoshii & Suhardjono) and P. sunae Zhang & Deharveng but differs in labial, dorsal chaetotaxy and unguiculus shape. Plumachaetas wanangensis sp. nov. is similar to other taxa bearing a mucro with four teeth, but presents a unique combination of macrochaetae on thoracic and abdominal segments. All species are arboreal and were collected in Malaise traps set in humid rainforests. A map of the geographic distribution and ecological remarks on the genus are provided and a key to species with a table summarising the main morphological features of all described taxa in the genus.

Scott, 1896, L. horstgeorgei George & Gheerardyn. 2015, and partly with L. hamatus (Thomson, 1883), and L. ornatus Krislinaswamy, 1957: (1) cephalothorax medio-laterally with triangular extensions and (2) postero-laterally with paired cuticular processes, (3) free body somites except telson dorsally with hyaline frills ending in rounded lappets, (4) furcal setae I and II displaced subapically, (5) antennar allobasis lacking abexopodal seta on endopodal half, (6) outer spines of the last segment of swimming legs 2 and 3 unipinnate and comblike, with the pinnae being extremely long and set widely apart. Thus, the named species are excluded from Laophontodes and united together with B. clarae gen. et sp. nov. in Bicorniphontodes gen. nov. as Bicorniphontodes bicornis comb. nov., B. hamatus comb. nov., B. horstgeorgei comb. nov., and B. ornatus comb. nov.. Beside the description of B. clarae gen. et sp. nov., a detailed phylogenetic discussion regarding the systematic relationships of the named species and the justification of the erection of Bicorniphontodes gen. nov. is given, including its distribution in the world's oceans. A key to species is also provided.

The new species belongs to the tropical Indo-Pacific subgenus Otohime in having a short rostral projection, short posttemporal spine, long opercular spine and no cleithral spine. It is most similar to P. (O.) multipunctata, and P (O.) urashimai, in having no large blotch on the first dorsal fin, a jet-black blotch and no white ocellus on the inner pectoral-fin surface, with no scales on the breast and front of the pectoral-fin base. However, the new species differs from the latter two species by the combination of the following characters: first dorsal-fin spines 7, second dorsal-fin rays 12, dusky rays on the inner pectoral-fin surface, one row of blackish botches on second dorsal fin, and no papillae on the dorsal surface of oral cavity. A key is provided for the twelve Pterygotrigla species now in the subgenus Otohime.

The resulting number of valid species is increased to 31, of which the following seven are described as new: P. ballux Reemer, sp. nov., P. brevis Reemer, sp. nov., P. costaricensis Reemer, sp. nov., P. notialus Reemer, sp. nov., P. palpator Reemer, sp. nov., P. pompiloides Reemer, sp. nov., and P. surinamensis Reemer, sp. nov. Two new synonymies are established: Microdon langi Curran, 1925, syn. nov. and Microdon flavomarginatum Curran, 1925, syn. nov. are both junior synonyms of Mulio bidens Fabricius, 1805. A neotype is designated for Microdon diaphanus Sack, 1921. This neotype, which has been reared from an ant nest, also represents the first case of a larval record for this genus. In some species, most notably in P. bidens (Fabricius) and P. normalis (Curran), discrete and distinct colour morphs are recognized, with strongly differing colouration of wings and abdomen.

Review of the moray eels (Anguilliformes: Muraenidae) of the Red Sea, with description of a new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Muraeninae; Uropterygiinae; systematic; phylogenetic analysis; Egypt; Saudi Arabia	GYMNOTHORAX-RETICULARIS; FISHES; PISCES; PHYLOGENIES	Thirty-eight species of moray eels (Muraenidae) from the Red Sea are reported in an updated review. A species account is provided for each species, along with a full synonymy of all nominal species described from the Red Sea. One species is new to science, G. pharaonis, and two species are new for the Red Sea, Gymnothorax phasmatodes (Smith) and Scuticaria tigrina (Lesson). Gymnothorax pharaonis n. sp. is a common species that has long been misidentified as G. undulatus (Lacepede), although it more closely resembles G. margaritophorus Bleeker, to which it is closely related phylogenetically. It is characterized by the following combination of characters: total vertebrae 123-128; body slender, depth at anus 17-28 in TL; maxillary teeth biserial, dentary and vomerine teeth in a single row; color brown with irregular dendritic pale markings, not interconnected or chain-like, with oblique, conspicuous, parallel streaks posteriorly in dorsal fin. The new record of the distinctive whitish G. phasmatodes is based on an underwater photograph taken at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The new record of Scuticaria tigrina is based on a specimen collected from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and underwater photographs taken from the northern part of the Red Sea. Based on an integrative taxonomical approach by a combination of morphological and phylogenetic analyses and re-examination of holotype specimens, Gymnothorax cinerascens (Ruppell) is resurrected as a valid species, and it is shown that previous records of G. hepaticus (Ruppell), with which it has previously been synonymized, should refer to G. cinerascens. The true G. hepaticus is redescribed based on examination of the holotype and additional specimens collected during the course of this study. The two species are distinguished by the color of the jaws, the position of the median intermaxillary teeth, and a slight difference in the preanal length. They are also clearly distinct genetically. The Red Sea record of Gymnothorax atolli (Pietschmann) is based on an error, possibly a misidentification of G. griseus (Lacepede). A key to the species of Red Sea moray eels and a phylogenetic tree of presently known lineages of Indo-Pacific moray eels are provided including recently collected Red Sea specimens.

Five species in three subgenera are recognized, including three new species, a new record, and an unidentified species. Eustomias (Dinematochirus) dendrobium sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congener by its unique barbel structure. Eustomias (Haploclonus) stamen sp. nov. has a unique barbel structure and diagnostic meristic characters. Eustomias (Nominostomias) tritentaculatus sp. nov. has an extremely long bathel and distinct pigmentation, with fin ray counts that are different from most similar species. Eustomias (Nominostomias) perplexus Gibbs, Clarke & Gomon 1983. widespread in the western Pacific Ocean is reported for the first time from Taiwan. Three specimens of Eustomias were only identifiable to subgenus Haploclonus due to their poor condition.

On the taxonomy of the genus Thyridanthrax Osten Sacken in Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with description of a new species (Diptera: Bombyliidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Thyridanthrax elegansoides; Thyridanthrax decipulus; Thyridanthrax polyphemus; new species; new records; identification key; diagnoses		Egyptian and Saudi Arabian Thyridanthrax spp. collected in field trips or preserved in the Efflatoun's insect collection in Cairo University were taxonomically studied. One new species, T. elegansoides sp. nov., is herein described, and two species, T. decipulus (Austen) and T. polyphemus (Wiedemann), are newly recorded from Egypt. Ten species are treated: one species from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, T. anomalus Greathead; two species from Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, T. decipulus (Austen) and T. perspicillaris (Loew), and seven species from Egypt: T. elegans (Wiedemann), T. elegansoides sp. nov., T. griseolus (Klug), T. incanus (Klug), T. lotus (Loew), T. obliteratus (Loew), and T. polyphemus (Wiedemann). Taxonomic comments, an identification key to species, diagnoses, and photographs of some species and genitalia are provided. Based on wing morphology and male genitalic characters, T. lotus clearly does not fit in the genus Thyridanthrax, and may need to be placed elsewhere, nevertheless it is not clear whether it can be included in any of the other currently recognized genera in the tribe Villini. It is here kept in Thyridanthrax until a more rigorous study can be conducted to better ascertain its position in the Villini.

Collastoma esotericum (Neodalyellida: Umagillidae), a new species of sipunculan-inhabiting rhabdocoel from Queensland, Australia	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Endosymbiont; Echinodermata; Sipuncula; Phascolosoma; Dalytyphloplanida; Provorticinae; Phylogenetics	TURBELLARIAN FLATWORM NEORHABDOCOELA; FALLACOHOSPES-INCHOATUS; PHYLOGENETIC POSITION; ANOPLODIUM-HYMANAE; PLATYHELMINTHES; INTESTINE; REVISITATION; SEQUENCES; COELOM	The Umagillidae Wahl, represent a group of endosymbiotic Platyhelminthes which inhabit two disparate invertebrate host groups, the echinoderms and sipunculans. Sipunculan-inhabiting umagillids are morphologically distinct from those inhabiting echinoderms and have traditionally been placed in a distinct genus and subfamily, Collastoma Dorler, and the Collastominae Wahl, respectively. Although molecular data are available for umagillid species inhabiting echinoids and holothurians, species inhabiting sipunculans have yet to be evaluated with molecular data. Collastoma esotericum n. sp. from the sipunculan Phascolosoma scolops (Selenka & de Man) collected in Moreton Bay, southeast Queensland, Australia, is described. Phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rRNA gene sequences placed C. esotericum in a Glade with species of the Umagillidae and the Provorticinae Luther, with strong support. However, within this Glade the relationship of C. esotericum to the Umagillidae and Provorticinae was not resolved.

Morphologically, M. gemina most closely resembles M. furca Bowman, 1957 known from the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America. Both these species are unique within the genus by their distinctively sexually dimorphic telsons. The new Costa Rican species can be distinguished from M. furca and other species of Mysidopsis by a combination of having a male with biarticulated endopods on the first pleopods and pleopods 2-5 with large plate-like pseudopodia (exites). The occurrence of these characters and morphological features within the subfamily Leptomysinae is discussed.	[Price, W.

(Diptera: Fergusoninidae) is described from Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. (Myrtaceae) in southern Australia. The adult fly is yellow with dark brown to black markings, the male postgonitcs have one large distal tooth and an ovoid subapical lobe with two lateral setae, the female postabdomen is short and sparsely setose, and the wing has a posterior cross vein. The larva possesses a dorsal shield comprising rows of raised spicules on thoracic segments 1-3 and abdominal segments 1-7, and the puparium is heavily sclerotised dark brown, barrel-shaped, bearing the dorsal shield. Fergusonina nodulosa sp. nov. forms nodular 'stem' galls initiating from the axial shoot buds. The galls are 2-8 mm in diameter with an average volume of 123 (range 25-480) mm(3). Thirteen species of Hymenoptera, comprising primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids of the gall fly and associated lepidopteran inquilines, and three species of Lepidoptera inquilines were reared from galls of this new species. Fergusonina nodulosa sp. nov. is associated with the obligate mutualist nematode, Fergusobia camaldulensae Davies.

The new species differs from all members of the S. annulatus and S. nebulatus groups because it has an ocellate pattern which places it into the S. argus species group. It differs from S. argus by having non-protuberant eyes. fewer ventrals, subcaudals. and total segmental counts; and it differs from S. longifrenis by having fewer segmental counts in males and females, only six supralabials and postmentals absent. Additionally, it differs from both species due to its smaller body size.

Although specimens from Mexico and Panama were previously identified as Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) bilk Lesson, 1830 the new species is easily distinguished morphologically and via mtDNA. In terms of morphology, the species can be identified by its olive-green background and white-orange papillae and tentacles, larger tentacles with deep indentations and also by larger buttons on the dorsal and ventral body wall, papillae and tube feet; large, thick and rough tentacle rods, and the absence of ossicles in the longitudinal muscles. The new species is included in the subgenus Mertensiothuria considering molecular evidence.

Four new Caribbean Sigambra species (Annelida, Pilargidae), and clarifications of three other Sigambra species	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						dorsal hooks; Fritz Muller; key to species; morphology; polychaetes; taxonomy	POLYCHAETA; REDESCRIPTIONS; N.	Sigambra grubii Muller, 1858 has been reported from many different coastal environments in Brazil and the Grand Caribbean. However, more than one species was thought to be included under this species group name. After the study of several subtle and consistent differences in specimens fitting the description S. grubii, a new Grand Caribbean species is herein recognized and described as S. hernandezi sp. nov. Further, the study of other Sigambra specimens prompted the examination of type specimens of S. bassi (Hartman, 1947), and of S. wassi Pettibone, 1966 to clarify some morphological features, and three other new species are recognized and newly described: S. diazi sp. nov. and S. ligneroi sp. nov. from the southeastern Caribbean (Venezuela), and S. olivai sp. nov. from the northwestern Caribbean (Mexico). Morphological features are also clarified for S. grubii by comparison with specimens from the type locality, Florian6polis, Brazil, and with type specimens of S. bassi from Florida (U.S.A.), and non-type specimens of S. wassi from Virginia (USA). A key to identify all species of Sigambra is also included.

The snail has a conical shell with pits and/or granules on embryonic whorls and a smooth teleoconch with straight peristome. The head of the animal has a developed wart. The mantle lobe is only developed on the left side. At the front of the buccal mass there is no chitinous jaw that is without exception seen in Chinese camaenids. Its radular teeth are usually slender and tongue-shaped, not typical in bradybaenine snails. The genital system is typical of Bradybaeninae and is characterized by the absence of a membranous sac surrounding the terminal genitalia, penial caecum or flagellum; a well-developed penis sheath; a symmetrical dart sac apparatus; and one distally branched mucous gland. The new species Sinorachis baihu Wu & Chen, gen. and sp. nov., is assigned to the type species of the new genus, in which all the known Chinese Rachis species are included. Thereby, the new genus is composed of three species, namely Sinorachis onychinus (Heude), comb. nov., Sinorachis aureus (Heude), comb. nov. and the new species.

It is established mainly based on the pectinate antenna comprising 42 flagellomeres and the proximal 28 bearing apical rami, which gradually shorten in length toward the apex of the flagellum. The pterostigma of the forewing is infuscated apically and on the hind wing, vein 1-Rs is nearly equal to 1r-m and slightly shorter than 1-M. The first tergum is widely excised posteriorly and roundly protruding laterally alike in Megalodontes. This find supports that pectinate antennae in extant sawflies of Megalodontesidae originated at least during or before the Early Cretaceous.

Integrative Systematic Revision of Bolitoglossa celaque (Caudata: Plethodontidae), with a new species from the Lenca Highlands of Honduras	HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						Bolitoglossa copinhorum sp. nov.; Chords block; Comparative morphology; Geomorphic morphometrics; Integrative taxonomy; Montane forests; Nuclear Central America; Osteology; Phylogenetics	DUNNI GROUP CAUDATA; MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS; AMPHIBIA PLETHODONTIDAE; SALAMANDERS CAUDATA; TAXONOMIC STATUS; FOOT MORPHOLOGY; TISSUE SAMPLES; GENOME SIZE; COMPLEX	The diversity of the tropical climbing salamander genus Bolitoglossa (Magnadigita) in Honduras has been underestimated historically, with 11 new species having been described in the past quarter-century. Bolitoglossa celaque is known to occur in three disjunct mountain ranges across the Lenca Highlands region of southwestern Honduras, and previous studies have independently demonstrated differences in mitochondrial genealogy and genome size between populations to the east and west of the Mejocote-San Juan Depression. Sampling from all three mountain ranges represented two genetically distinct clades: one associated with the vicinity of the type locality, Montana de Celaque, and the second consisting of several eastern populations from the departments of Intibud and La Paz. Distinctiveness of these two clades was further investigated and supported by analyses of morphological variation, geometric morphometrics of foot morphology, and comparative osteology. Based on congruent signals from each line of evidence, we restrict the taxon B. celaque to Montana de Celaque and describe the eastern populations as a new species of Bolitoglossa.

Phoxophrys After 60 Years: Review of Morphology, Phylogeny, Status of Pelturagonia, and a New Species from Southeastern Kalimantan	HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Review						Agamidae; Borneo; Computed tomography; Osteology; Pelturagonia anolophium sp. nov.; Skull; Sumatra; Systematics	PSEUDOCALOTES SQUAMATA AGAMIDAE; BUKIT BARISAN RANGE; REPTILIA AGAMIDAE; GENUS; LIZARDS; SYSTEMATICS; DNA; CHARACTERS; SUMATRA; DRAGONS	We review morphology and systematics of Phoxophrys using new specimens of previously rare species. In addition to external characters, we relied heavily on skull morphology visualized using computed tomography data of all currently recognized species in this genus. Phylogenetic analysis of ND4, 12S, and 16S mDNA sequences reveal that Ph. tuberculate is sister to a Glade containing Dendragama, Lophocalotes, and insular Pseudocalotes. Phoxophrys tuberculate is only distantly related to Bornean congeners. Phylogenetic analysis of 29 morphological characters scored for all the species of Phoxophrys and a diverse set of 22 outgroup tail found four well-supported lineages: Ph. tuberculate, a Glade of all Bornean congeners, Ph. nigrilabris, and a Glade of the four large Bornean species. To resolve paraphyly of Phoxophrys, we revalidate Pelturagonia Mocquard for all Bornean species of this genus. As redefined, Phoxophrys contains a single species: Ph. tuberculate of Sumatra. We describe a new species of Pelturagonia from the Meratus Range of southeastern Kalimantan. The new species is the sister species of Pe. spiniceps. Like that species, it differs from congeners in having large, dorsally projecting scales between the dorsolateral caudal crests and a postorbital process of the frontal bone reaching the postciliary ornament.

Taxonomic revision of the late-Pleistocene/Holocene land-mollusc fauna (Gastropoda: Eupulmonata) of the Desertas Islands, Madeiran Archipelago, with the description of 6 new species and 2 new subspecies	ARCHIV FUR MOLLUSKENKUNDE			English	Article						New name; rank elevation; lectotype designation; neotype; fossil designation	PORTO-SANTO; EASTERN MADEIRA; SNAIL FAUNAS; SHELL SIZE	New sites containing fossil-rich Quaternary deposits have been discovered on Deserta Grande and Bugio, islands in the Madeiran Archipelago, Portugal. Examination of these, together with a reassessment of earlier collections, has led to the identification and description of 6 new species and 2 new subspecies. The revised taxonomy involves species in the genera Leiostyla (Lauriidae: desertaensis n. sp., simulans n. sp., cooki n. sp., castanheiraensis n. sp.), Actinella (fecundaerrata n. nom.), Discula (cameroni n. sp., polymorpha docaensis n. ssp.) (all Geomitridae), and Leptaxis (Hygromiidae: isambertoi n. sp., groviana antiqua n. ssp.). In addition, lectotypes are designated for Helix pittae Paiva, 1866, Helix actinophora var. beta descendens Wollaston, 1878, and Helix vulgata var. epsilon saxipotens Wollaston, 1878, and the latter 2 am elevated to species rank. Their binomial names are now Caseolus pittae, Actinella descendens, and Actinella saxipotens. For Helix senilis var. gamma pusilla R.T. Lowe, 1855 a neotype is designated, and the new name Actinella fecundaerrata given to replace the pre-occupied name. Further notes are given on findings of species of the genera Cecilioides (Ferussaciidae), Helicomela, Geomitra, and Spirorbula (all Geomitridae) on the Desertas Islands.

Because freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems of the Aegean Islands have undergone processes of formation and geographical isolation differentiating them from the adjacent mainland, they have attracted many scientists. Although several papers describing the freshwater molluscs of these islands have been published, there is no such study about the Turkish islands of Gokceada and Bozcaada located in the northern Aegean Sea. This study describes the diversity of the freshwater mollusc fauna of Gokceada. Sampling of freshwater snails by kick-net and hand-collection was carried out throughout the island, covering diverse habitats including fountains, streams, and artificial ponds. The findings include the first records of Dreissena polymorpha and Pisidium subtruncatum from Gokceada and the invasive gastropod Physella acuta. Furthermore, we present descriptions of the anatomy and shells of four new species of freshwater snails: Pseudamnicola cirikorum sp. n., Pseudamnicola radeae sp. n., Grossuana kayrae sp. n., and Bythinella gokceadaensis sp. n. We compare these new species (except G. kayrae sp. n.) with previously described congeners from the Sporades, mainland Greece, and western Turkey. Because Grossuana had previously not been recorded from Turkey, G. kayrae is compared with Greek and Balkan (southwestern Thrace) Grossuana species.

The new species is distinct among the Indian congeners due to its stout and distinctly sinuous terminal segment of the male first gonopod. Among the Sri Lankan species of Oziotelphusa Muller, 1887, O. naga sp. nov. resembles O. minneriyaensis Bott, 1970, in the structure of the male gonopods but can easily be distinguished by the less convex dorsal surface of the carapace, the relatively more narrow frontal median triangle, and the relatively longer male second gonopod. Oziotelphusa is now represented by 18 species: eight species from India and 10 from Sri Lanka. The distributional records of all the Indian species of Oziotelphusa are provided.

The anemone-crab partnership is a mutualism in which hermit crabs provide a hard substrate, increased access to oxygenated waters and food supply, in exchange for defense by the anemone. The vast majority of the sea anemone partners belong to three genera in family Hormathiidae: Adamsia, Calliactis, Paracalliactis. Given the remarkable nature of the symbiosis, hormathiid partners have been hypothesized to represent a monophyletic group. This has been rejected by Gusmao and Daly et al. (2010) and confirmed by our phylogenetic analysis using molecular markers (12S, 16S, 18S, 28S, COIII). We expand the results of Gusmao and Daly et al. (2010) by finding a monophyletic Paracalliactis, which was left untested in their analyses. Thus, characters of taxonomic significance associated to the symbiotic habit are interpreted as functional rather than phylogenetic. We reconcile taxonomy and the present evolutionary framework to avoid defining taxonomic groups based on characters prone to convergence. We formalize the synonymy of Adamsia and Calliactis and provide updated diagnoses for the valid genera Calliactis and Paracalliactis to bring more stability to the group. Under this new framework, we describe Calliactis tigris sp. nov. from Australia based on 21 specimens collected off the coast of New South Wales and Queensland and differentiate it from congeners and other hermit crab symbionts recorded in the Pacific Ocean.

Some scientists claim that cryptic diversity is a real phenomenon that should be extensively studied while others argue that cryptic species do not exist as they are nothing more than an incompatibility of species concepts. We investigated the enigmatic case of two widely distributed Caribbean intertidal oribatid mites, Carinozetes bermudensis and Carinozetes mangrovi, consisting of five distinct genetic lineages. Morphological features allowing to clearly distinguish between these lineages are absent, and despite certain congruence with genetic data, comprehensive morphometric analyses also do not show clear separation. Species delimitation analyses based on COI sequence data, on the other hand, suggest five distinct genetic species. Despite the lack of diagnostic characters for these suggested species, the lineages can be classified at least into two morphological groups, the bermudensis and the mangrovi group which can only be distinguished by the arrangement of cuticular ventral carinae. Specimens within a group show nearly identical phenotypes, impeding morphological identification and hence rendering the found diversity cryptic. Stabilizing selection caused by the extreme conditions of the intertidal environment is suggested to be responsible for the found morphological stasis. The genetic lineages show more or less clear geographic patterns; in C. mangrovi, there is a northern, an Antillean, and a Pacific lineage, whereas in C. bermudensis, there is a Bermudian and a Caribbean lineage. In a few places, e.g., the Bahamas and Panama, distributions may overlap. Neither the found biogeographic pattern nor the observed ecological needs could explain the reason for the genetic diversification of Caribbean Carinozetes.

The genus can be considered as a 'species flock'. However, the validity of many species is questionable: the great similarity in their description and the lack of unequivocal diagnostic characters often lead species identification to an impasse. In order to clarify the systematics of this genus, we analysed two nuclear and two mitochondrial DNA markers of 40 Baikalodrilus specimens. DNA and morphological approaches are mostly congruent in suggesting ten candidate species, although two additional species are suspected. A reassessment of the taxonomic value of the morphological characteristics of Baikalodrilus suggests that there are few that can be used as distinctive, specific criteria in the genus. The association between candidate and nominal species remains problematic, except for three species identified prior to molecular analyses. Baikalodrilus trituberculum sp. nov. is described. Phylogenetic inferences suggests that the earliest split in Baikalodrilus and the time of divergence of most lineages corresponding to species are consistent with the hypothesis of a general rearrangement of the Baikal fauna, following major environmental changes due to a general cooling in the Early Pleistocene.

Maristella belongs to a diverse Caribbean clade of bioluminescent ostracods in which males perform species-specific luminescent courtship displays. Other genera of the clade include Enewton, Photeros, Konickeria and, nominally, Vargula.Maristella is likely the most species-rich genus in the clade. Maristella chicoi sp. nov., from Belize, is described as the type species. Species from Panama reassigned to Maristella are Vargula ignitula, V. lucidella, V. micamacula, V. noropsela, V. psammobia, V. scintilla. New information is presented on the sixth and eighth limbs of the species from Panama, providing additional characters for distinguishing taxa. Maristella is the only genus that contains species with lateral or diagonal luminescent courtship displays. Maristella chicoi has male displays oriented horizontal to the substrate and showing high levels of entrainment. The displays run in near-parallel bifurcations resulting in spectacular fan-like radiations of light pulse trains. The description of Maristella advances the taxonomy of the highly diverse Caribbean clade that has become a model system for studying the evolution of bioluminescence and the role of luminescent displays in speciation.

We studied the largest known fossil galatheoid assemblage, from the Late Jurassic of Ernstbrunn, Austria. This coral-associated assemblage yielded 2348 specimens, arranged in 53 species, 22 genera and six families. Rarefaction analyses show that nearly all taxa have been collected. In addition to abundant Munidopsidae, this assemblage also contains the oldest members of four of the six galatheoid families, including Galatheidae, Munididae, Paragalatheidae and Porcellanidae. We describe the oldest Porcellanidae and Galatheidae to date, and a catillogalatheid: Vibrissalana jurassica gen. et sp. nov., ?Galathea genesis sp. nov. and Galatheites britmelanarum sp. nov. Our re-examination of the oldest claimed porcellanid, Jurellana tithonia, from Ernstbrunn, indicates that it represents a homolodromioid brachyuran, ascribed to Jurellanidae fam. nov. along with Ovalopus gen. nov. The second-oldest claimed porcellanid, Early Cretaceous Petrolisthes albianicus, is transferred to the catillogalatheid Hispanigalathea. We further document that 10.4% of Ernstbrunn galatheoid specimens were parasitized by epicaridean isopods, as shown by swellings in the gill region. Statistical analyses indicate that infestation is near non-random, varying from 0 to 33% for common species. Thus, Late Jurassic coral-associated habitats were key ecosystems in the evolution of galatheoids and their parasites.

The two-horned scorpionfly Dicerapanorpa is a small genus in Panorpidae (Mecoptera) endemic to the Qinling-Bashan and Hengduan mountains, a biodiversity hotspot. However, species of Dicerapanorpa are difficult to delineate owing to marked intraspecific variation and interspecific similarity. Here, we investigate the diversity and species boundaries of Dicerapanorpa using an integrative approach based on DNA barcoding, morphological, geometric morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analyses. This integrative analyses confirmed the 13 described species of Dicerapanorpa and revealed three new species: Dicerapanorpa lativalva sp. nov., Dicerapanorpa hualongshana sp. nov. and Dicerapanorpa minshana sp. nov. Most molecular operational taxonomic units are in congruence with morphological clusters. Possible reasons for several discordances in Dicerapanorpa are tentatively discussed.

We provide a phylogenetic analysis of this tribe based on morphological characters and molecular markers. Monophyly of the tribe was not supported by our findings. The Rhinocylapus complex and Rhinomiriella complex are transferred to Fulviini. Rhinomirini are restricted to the Rhinomiris complex. The record of Rhinomirini in Australia is considered dubious. The genera Punctifulvius and Yamatofulvus are transferred to the Rhinocylapus complex. The Rhinocylapus complex is recorded from Australia for the first time, with four new species: Mycetocylapus alexeyi sp. nov., Punctifulvius austellus sp. nov., Punctifulvius aquilonius sp. nov. and Rhinocylapoides valentinae sp. nov. The Philippine species Mycetocylapus major is synonymized with Mycetocylapus minor. The Australian species Rhinomiriella tuberculata is redescribed, and females of this species are described for the first time. Rhinomiriella aidani sp. nov. is described as new to science. The female genitalia of Proamblia elongata, Rhinocylapidius velocipidoides and Rhinomiris conspersus and the male genitalia of Rhinomiris conspersus and Rhinomiridius aethiopicus are illustrated and discussed. Sexual dimorphism in the Rhinocylapus complex and wing modifications in Cylapinae are discussed.

Synactinernus flavus Carlgren, 1918, the only described species of this genus, is rediscovered from off the Goto Islands a century after the original description. Synactinernus flavus was once synonymized with Isactinernus quadrilobatus Carlgren, 1918; however, we show that, based on morphological (including examination of type specimens) and molecular (using nuclear 18S rDNA) evidence, these species are completely different. The other species, Synactinernus churaumi sp. nov., was found off Ishigaki Island and Okinawa Island by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and had been kept for 15 years in a tank at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium. There are clear differences between these two species; therefore, we describe the second species and revise the diagnosis of Synactinernus.

The nebriine taxon Archaeonebria inexspectata gen. n., sp. n., is described and imaged based on four fossil specimens preserved in the Eocene Baltic amber using light microscopy and X-ray micro-computed tomography. The new taxon shares likely synapomorphies with the amphipacific genus Nippononebria and is therefore proposed as its sister group. The occurrence of Archaeonebria in the Baltic amber forests supports previous assumptions that these forests grew under temperate, at least warm-temperate, climatic conditions.

However, a thorough morphological comparison between Brazilian material reported as A. macrocheles and eastern Atlantic material of A. macrocheles revealed consistent differences, suggesting that the Brazilian specimens belong to an unde scribed species. Alpheus ramosportoae sp. nov. is therefore now described based on material from Amapa to Pernambuco, Brazil. Morphological differences between the new species and A. macrocheles s. str. were supported by the clear divergence of 16S rRNA gene sequences (18% of genetic distance), separating the species in two distinct clades.

J	Hammer, MP; Allen, GR; Martin, KC; Adams, M; Unmack, PJ				Hammer, Michael P.; Allen, Gerald R.; Martin, Keith C.; Adams, Mark; Unmack, Peter J.			Two new species of dwarf rainbowfishes (Atheriniformes: Melanotaeniidae) from northern Australia and southern New Guinea	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						fishes; freshwater biodiversity; conservation; taxonomy; molecular systematics	OLFACTORY ORGAN; FISH; FRESH; BIOGEOGRAPHY; BIODIVERSITY	The 'maccullochi species group' of rainbowfishes are small and distinctly patterned freshwater fishes of streams and swamps, comprising around eight species. The species from which the group bears its name, Melanotaenia maccullochi Ogilby, 1915, has been thought to comprise three forms occurring in distinct geographic areas, and recent mitochondrial genetic data provides matching patterns of likely inter-specific divergence. Here we undertake a detailed investigation of the taxonomic status of M. maccullochi using a combined lines of evidence approach incorporating multiple nuclear genetic markers (55 allozyme loci), mitochondrial DNA sequence data (1141 bp cytochrome b) and morphology (examination of a suite of 38 morphometric and meristic characters). As all three datasets provide support for a three-way split, we accordingly describe two new species and redescribe M. maccullochi sensu stricto. McCulloch's Rainbowfish M. maccullochi, a species with brown body stripes and red fins occurs in northeast Queensland and is redescribed based on 338 specimens, 13.1-53.0 mm SL. This species was one of the first rainbowfishes to become known in the aquarium hobby. A second form with darker stripes on a contrasting light white-grey body and with distinct sub-marginal black bands in the dorsal and anal fins, distributed across northern and eastern Cape York Peninsula, Torres Strait and southern central New Guinea, is described as Sahul Rainbowfish M. sahulensis sp. nov. based on 267 specimens, 13.4-48.4 mm SL. A diminutive and well geographically isolated form occurring below the escarpment of the Tabletop Range in Litchfield National Park, Northern Territory possessing a more prominent and purplish mid-lateral stripe, is described as the Little Rainbowfish Melanotaenia wilsoni sp. nov. based on 50 specimens, 19.3-33.3 mm SL. A combination of morphological characters is useful for separating the respective taxa with M. wilsoni sp. nov. the most distinctive, typically having fewer vertebrae, lateral scales, cheek scales, procurrent caudal rays and anal rays and proportionally a shorter maxilla and snout than either of the other two species. Useful characters for further separating M. sahulensis sp. nov. from M. maccullochi include slightly higher counts of vertebrae, lateral scales and anal rays and proportionally greater body depth, body width and pre-dorsal distance. Information on the known distribution, habitats and conservation status of the three species is summarised, with the Northern Territory species being a narrow-range endemic with specific environmental requirements.

Cyrtodactylus muangfuangensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from remaining congeners by the following combination of characters: maximum SVL 83.9 mm; dorsal pattern consisting of dark nuchal loop, nape band and five dark transversal bands between limb insertions; intersupranasals two; dorsal tubercles present on occiput, body, hind limbs and tail base; 15 or 16 irregular dorsal tubercle rows at midbody; lateral folds clearly defined, without interspersed tubercles; 31-37 ventral scales between ventrolateral folds; six precloacal pores and 15 femoral pores in males, which are interrupted by six to eight poreless scales; six precloacal pitted scales plus in total 10-15 pitted femoral scales in females, which are separated by six to eight poreless scales; enlarged precloacal and femoral scales present; two or three postcloacal tubercles; median subcaudal scales transversely enlarged. In molecular analyses, the new species is strongly supported as a member of the Cyrtodactylus phongnhakebangensis species group, and weakly corroborated as a sister taxon to C. pageli. Pairwise genetic comparison shows that it is at least 18% divergent from other congeners in the species group based on a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene.

Further specimens of M. alani (all mature) are reported: a male and two females from the Phnom Kulen Mts, NW Cambodia and five males and one female from Mondulkiri Province, E Cambodia. The appendage shape in mature males is illustrated and discussed and the female is described for the first time. The specimens from E Cambodia are ca 15-20% larger than those from SW and NW Cambodia and exhibit some differences in the shapes of the male epiproct and anterior hamulus and face maculation, however evaluated as insufficient to erect a new taxon. A hitherto neglected manifestation of sexual dimorphism in probably most Microgomphus spp. and at least some Heliogomphus spp. is pointed out. It concerns the mid- and metafemur, in males armed with numerous, dense and small spinulets but with two rows of long, sparse spines in females. An earlier report of Microgomphus jurzitzai Karube, 2000 for Cambodia was based on a misidentified M alani specimen and is cancelled. A female specimen earlier identified and described from Thailand as Heliogomphus selysi Fraser, 1925 most probably was M. alani as well.

We performed quantitative parasitological surveys of 653 individual fish from each of the 44 species using the intertidal sand flats that border the atoll's lagoon. We provide morphological descriptions, prevalence, and mean intensities of the recovered seven species of adult nematode (Pulchrascaris chiloscyllii, Capillariidae gen. sp., Cucullanus bourdini, Cucullanus oceaniensis, Pseudascarophis sp., Spinitectus (Paraspinitectus) palmyraensis sp. nov., Philometra pellucida) and three larval stages (Pulchrascaris sp., Hysterothylacium sp., Cucullanus sp.). We recorded: Pulchrascaris chiloscyllii from Carcharhinus melanopterus; Capillariidae gen. sp. from Chaetodon lunula, Lutjanus fulvus, and Ellochelon vaigiensis; Cucullanus bourdini from Arothron hispidus; Cucullanus oceaniensis from Abudefduf sordidus; Pseudascarophis sp. from Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon lunula, and Mulloidichthys flavolineatus; Spinitectus (Paraspinitectus) palmyraensis sp. nov. from Albula glossodonta; Philometra pellucida from Arothron hispidus; and three larval forms, Pulchrascaris sp. from Acanthurus triostegus, Acanthurus xanthopterus, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, Platybelone argalus, Carangoides ferdau, Carangoides orthogrammus, Caranx ignobilis, Caranx melampygus, Caranx papuensis, Chaetodon auriga, Chanos chanos, Amblygobius phalaena, Asterropteryx semipunctata, Valencienea sexguttata, Kyphosus cinerascens, Lutjanus fulvus, Lutjanus monostigma, Ellochelon vaigiensis, Mulloidichthys flavolineatus, Upeneus taeniopterus, Gymnothorax pictus, Abudefduf septemfasciatus, Abudefduf sordidus, and Stegastes nigricans; Hysterothylacium sp. type MD from Acanthurus triostegus, Carangoides ferdau, Chaetodon lunula, Chanos chanos, Kyphosus cinerascens, Abudefduf sordidus, and Arothron hispidus; and Cucullanus sp. from Caranx ignobilis. Spinitectus (Paraspinitectus) palmyraensis sp. nov. (Cystidicolidae) is described from the intestine of roundjaw bonefish Albula glossodonta. All the nematode species reported in this study represent new geographical records. We discuss how our survey findings compare to other areas of the Indo-Pacific, and the way the relatively numerical dominance of trophically transmitted larval stages likely reflect the intact food web of Palmyra Atoll, which includes a large biomass of large-bodied top predator sharks and ray-finned fishes.

Onchidium melakense is a rare species with only nine individuals found at three mangrove sites in the Andaman Islands and the Strait of Malacca (western Peninsular Malaysia and eastern Sumatra). The new species is delineated based on mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (ITS2 and 28S) DNA sequences as well as comparative anatomy. Each Onchidium species is characterized by a distinct color and can easily be identified in the field, even in the Strait of Malacca where there are three sympatric Onchidium species. An identification key is provided. In addition, Onchidium stuxbergi (Westerlund, 1883) is recorded for the first time from eastern Sumatra, and Onchidium pallidipes Tapparone-Canefri, 1889, of which the type material is described and illustrated here, is regarded as a new junior synonym of O. stuxbergi.

Lithobius (Ezembius) hualongensis sp. nov. and Lithobius (Ezembius) sui sp. nov. (Lithobiomorpha, Lithobiidae) recently discovered from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China are described. Morphologically, the two new species are very similar but can be distinguished by the number of coxosternal teeth: L. (E.) hualongensis sp. nov. has 2 + 2 while L. (E.) sui sp. nov. has 3 + 3. The two new species resemble L.

Under an integrative taxonomic approach: the description of a new species of the genus Loxosceles (Araneae, Sicariidae) from Mexico City	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						DNA barcodes; ecological niche modeling; Loxosceles tenochtitlan sp. nov.; species delimitation; taxonomy	COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; SPIDERS ARANEAE; NICHE MODELS; DELIMITATION; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; CONSERVATION	A new species of the spider genus Loxosceles Heineken & Lowe, 1832, Loxosceles tenochtitlan Valdez-Mondragon & Navarro-Rodriguez, sp. nov., is described based on adult male and female specimens from the states of Mexico City, Estado de Mexico and Tlaxcala. Integrative taxonomy including traditional morphology, geometric and lineal morphology, and molecules (DNA barcodes of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)), were used as evidence to delimit the new species. Four methods were used for molecular analyses and species delimitation: 1) corrected p-distances under neighbor joining (NJ), 2) automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD), 3) general mixed yule coalescent model (GMYC), and 4) poisson tree processes (bPTP). All molecular methods, traditional, geometric and lineal morphology were consistent in delimiting and recognizing the new species. Loxosceles tenochtitlan sp. nov. is closely related to L. misteca based on molecular data. Although both species are morphologically similar, the average p-distance from CO1 data was 13.8% and 4.2% for ITS2 data. The molecular species delimitation methods recovered well-supported monophyletic clusters for samples of L. tenochtitlan sp. nov. from Mexico City + Tlaxcala and for samples of L. misteca from Guerrero. Loxosceles tenochtitlan sp. nov. is considered a unique species for three reasons: (1) it can be distinguished by morphological characters (genitalic and somatic); (2) the four different molecular species delimitation methods were congruent to separate both species; and (3) there is variation in leg I length of males between both species, with the males of L. misteca having longer legs than males of L. tenochtitlan sp. nov., also morphometrically, the shape of tibiae of the palp between males of both species is different.

Considering that the delimitation of some of the included species-groups is incongruent in the literature, this work tackled one particularly problematic group, the dispar group, which includes species that, depending on the classification scheme, have been classified in two other groups, namely the spondiae and alternatus groups. We recognize six valid species in the dispar group, viz. A. dispar (Sharp, 1885), A. crassipunctatus Ribeiro-Costa, 1999c A. insuturatus (Pic, 1902), A. schwarzi Kingsolver, 1970, A. taeniopygus Ribeiro-Costa, 1999 c, and Amblycerus goianiensis Santos & Ribciro-Costa, sp. n., and four in the spondiae group, viz. A. spondiae Kingsolver, 1980, A. cuernavacensis Romero, Johnson & Kingsolver, 1996,A. vitis (Schaeffer, 1907) andA. alternatus (Pic, 1954). Three species are excluded from their original groups, namely A. eustrophoides (Schaeffer, 1904), A. serieguttatus (Chevrolat, 1877), from the alternatus group, and A. simulator (Jacquelin DuVal, 1857), from the dispar group, all considered here as incertae sedis. The remaining species of the alternatus group, A. schwarzi and A. alternatus, are transferred to other previously mentioned groups, thus dissolving this group. We provide diagnoses for the 13 species studied, redescribe three species, and describe one new species. Color illustrations of the dorsum and pygidium, drawings of the male genitalia and geographic distribution maps are included. Identification keys are also added for the dispar and spondiae groups. We record new host plants for four Amblycerus species and new localities for five species. The plant taxa Sarcomphalus mistol (Griseb.) Hauenschild, Terminalia corrugata (Ducke) Gere & Boatwr., T. tetraphylla (Aubl.) Gere & Boatwr. and Rhus virens Lindh. ex A. Gray var. choriophylla (Wooton & Standi.) L. D. Benson are first registered here as hosts of Amblycerus. Four new records forAmblycerus, namely Capparis, Neopringlea, Rhus and Sarcomphalus, and two new records at the family level, Capparaceae A.

Pseudotelegeusis Wittmer, 1976 is composed of three species, two occurring in northern South America and one in Mexico. Here we describe the fourth species for the genus, Pseudotelegeusis meloi sp. nov., collected in a Malaise sample from the region of Madre de Dios, Peru. The new species is diagnosed mainly by the antennae serrate from antennomeres III to X, eyes occupying half of head width in lateral view and vertex occupying 3/5 of head in dorsal view. This new species is close to the other two South American species, P. howdeni Wittmcr, 1976 and P. oculatus Wittmcr, 1976, according to the serrate antennae and number of ventrites. The three South American species differ from the Mexican species, P. jiliotupaensis Zaragoza-Caballero, 2008, by the different antennae and the number of ventrites, which indicates that the Mexican species should possibly be classified in a different genus. The main morphological characters, including maxillar palpi, tentorial pits and male genitalia, are illustrated, and an updated key to the species of Pseudotelegeusis is given, as well as distribution maps.

Dorsal sculpture is, in general, considered to be species-specific and not very variable; however, many problems have arisen due to various interpretations of microscope images, which has led to taxonomic confusion in the genus Echiniscus. Conversely, chaetotaxy is generally much easier to interpret, even using low-quality microscope optics. In this study, we emended the description of Madagascar' population of Echiniscus tristis Gasiorek & Kristensen, 2018 that exhibits several different types of chaetotaxy and dorsal sculpture. The analysed specimens were characterised by two types of eliactotaxy,A-C-D-d-E andA-D-d-E, but we also found a wide range of variation in appendage number, shape and length. The observed differences are partly correlated with life stages. Additionally, we analysed DNA sequences of 28S rRNA, ITS-2 and COI of the two main morphotypes, and did not find significant genetic differentiation of the two morphotypes. This highlights the importance of analysing the morphology of both immature stages and adults, as well as of DNA markers in tardigrade species identification.

The new taxon was discovered while surveying palms for potential phytoplasma vectors. Placement in a new genus is supported by a 1,383 bp sequence of 18S that differs by 2.77% from Haplaxius, 5.20% from Myndus taffini, and 2.80% from Nymphomyndus caribbea. Intrageneric variation for 18S was found to be approximately 0.5% to 0.6% within Haplaxius. Generic level differences within the Oecleini for COI ranged from 15% to 17% with the novel taxon differing by about 16% from other genera. The new genus is most similar in appearance to Haplaxius but possesses striking sexual dimorphism, and the aedeagus is only partially surrounded by the phallobase (versus entirely enveloped in Haplaxius). The discovery of a novel taxon of cixiid on palms that is similar to Haplaxius is important because of the role that Haplaxius crudus plays in phytoplasma transmission in palm agro- and natural ecosystems.

The species is often observed in underwater photographs from untrawled parts of carbonate mounds in the area. Trissopathes grasshoffi sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from its three congeners by having relatively sparse branching, a higher density of primary pinnules, and 3-6 secondary anterolateral pinnules as well as by the shape and size of its spines.

It is concluded here that a subsequent type designation by Horn (1910), who without any explanation mentioned Ch. auripennis (Lucas, 1857) as the type species of the genus, was unjustified and must be considered invalid according to ICZN (1999). Examinations of type specimens have revealed that Cheilonycha auripennis sensu auctorum (sensu Horn 1922 and subsequent authors) is a complex of taxa. As a result, one new subspecies of Ch. auripennis (Lucas, 1857) and one new species of the genus are described and the following taxa of Cheilonycha are recognized and presented here: Ch. chalybea (Dejean, 1825), Ch. a. auripennis (Lucas, 1857), Ch. a. chiquitosiana ssp. nov. and Ch. bucephalauripennis sp. nov. Type specimens of Ch. a. angustedilatata (W. Horn, 1922) based on Odontochila (Chilonycha) auripennis angustedilatata W. Horn, 1922, proved to be fully conspecific with the type specimens of Ch. auripennis based on Cicindela auripennis Lucas, 1857. Consequently, Ch. a. angustedilatata syn. nov. is treated here as a junior synonym of Ch. a. auripennis. The history of the taxonomy of these taxa, their distribution and biology, including photographs of the termitophilous habitat, relevant lectotype designations, descriptions (redescriptions respectively) and illustrations in colour photographs of the habitus, diagnostic characters and variability are provided.

Using morphology and the COI barcoding gene we describe a new forest dwelling species, Latrodectus umbukwane n. sp. Wright, Wright, Lyle and Engelbrecht. Females have red markings on both the ventral and posterior dorsal surfaces of the abdomen, parallel spermathecae and three loops of the copulatory ducts. Males have an embolus with four loops and diagnostic white markings on the ventral surface of the abdomen that darken with age. Egg sacs are smooth, large, and bright purple when freshly laid, turning shiny grey with time. Latrodectus umbukwane n. sp. is known only from sand forest vegetation types in northern Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A predicted geographic distribution for this species is provided based on cartographic mapping of known habitat and altitudinal preference, from which area of occupancy (AOO; 698 km(2)) and extent of occurrence (EOO; 4963 km2) were calculated to assess potential IUCN Red List status. Due to the uncertainty of the distribution of this species, a Red List status of Data Deficient (DD) is recommended. An updated key to the southern African species of Latrodectus is provided.

Recent investigations of subterranean cave-dwelling fauna revealed a diversity of new taxa, including several new niphargid species. All of these new findings have been recorded from the north and north-west of the country, in Alborz and Northern Zagros regions. This paper describes a cave species from the Central Zagros, the southernmost range border of the genus Niphargus. A full morphological description of the species, as well as a brief note on the ecology of the cave, is presented, along with a detailed comparison to morphologically related or geographically close species. The most distinctive characters of this species are its long and slender pereopod III-VII, no spine on the dorsal surface of the telson, and the short second article of the uropod III exopodite. These data suggest that this is a new species, N. keeleri sp. nov., which is named after the cave in which it was found in.

In this study, we combine molecular genetic analyses using one nuclear gene (histone h3) and two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and ribosomal 16S RNA) with morphological data to ameliorate the identification of specimens from this complex in East Africa. We include a detailed examination of polymorphisms within the group. As a result, Chromodoris boucheti is synonymized with Chromodoris lochi, and two new species are described, Chromodoris celinae sp. nov. and Chromodoris helium sp. nov. Chromodoris celinae sp. nov. is a common shallow water species that was previously misidentified as C. hamiltoni. Chromodoris helium sp. nov. is a species that appears to be restricted to depths below 30 m. This study agrees with previous research indicating the recent divergence of the genus Chromodoris.

J	Maddison, WP				Maddison, Wayne P.			A new lapsiine jumping spider from North America, with a review of Simon's Lapsias species (Araneae, Salticidae, Spartaeinae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Review						Guatemala; jumping spider; Lapsiini; Mexico; Venezuela		A new spider genus and species from Mexico and Guatemala, Amilaps mayana gen. et sp. nov., is described, distinct from other members of the jumping spider tribe Lapsiini (subfamily Spartaeinae) by its four retromarginal cheliceral teeth and the large sclerite cradling the embolus. It is the first living lapsiine known outside of South America. This tribe has received attention recently for new species and genera in Ecuador and Brazil, but Simon's original four species of Lapsias, described from Venezuela in 1900 and 1901, remain relatively poorly known. Accordingly, new illustrations of Simon's type material are given, and a lectotype is designated for L. cyrboides Simon, 1900. The three forms of females in Simon's material from Colonia Tovar, Aragua, are reviewed and illustrated, and they are a tentatively matched with the three male lectotypes of his species from the same location.

Two new nematode species of the genus Tobrilus Andrassy, 1959 (Nematoda, Triplonchida) from Lake Baikal, Russia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Free-living nematodes; diversity; morphology; taxonomy	SP N. NEMATODA	Two new nematode species of the genus Tobrilus Andrassy, 1959 from Lake Baikal are described and illustrated. The first species Tobrilus elginus sp. nov. was found in the littoral zone of Maloye More Bays. The second species Tobrilus juliae sp. nov. dwells on bodies of dead sponges Lubomirskia baicalensis (Pallas, 1776). Tobrilus elginus sp. nov. is most similar to T. amabilis Tsalolikhin, 1974 and T. bekmanae Tsalolikhin, 1975. In contrast to the first species it has a shorter body and spicules, longer gubernaculum and a shorter supplements row. Its body is shorter and thinner, tail and supplement row are shorter and the vulva is more posterior as compared to the second species. The body size of Tobrilus juliae sp. nov. is most similar to T. securus Gagarin & Naumova, 2011 and T. saprophagus Naumova & Gagarin, 2017. From the first of these species it differs by the thinner body, shorter tail, comparatively shorter outer labial setae and shorter spicules. It differs from the second species by a thinner body, shorter male tail and shorter labial setae.

A species-level taxonomic review and host associations of Glyptapanteles (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Microgastrinae) with an emphasis on 136 new reared species from Costa Rica and Ecuador	ZOOKEYS			English	Review						Central America; diversity; mtDNA; natural history; parasitoid wasps; South America	PARASITOID WASPS; CONSERVACION GUANACASTE; LEPIDOPTERA-NOCTUIDAE; LIFE-HISTORY; GENUS; REVISION; DIVERSITY; GENERA; AREA; KEY	The descriptive taxonomic study reported here is focused on Glyptapanteles, a species-rich genus of hymenopteran parasitoid wasps. The species were found within the framework of two independent long-term Neotropical caterpillar rearing projects: northwestern Costa Rica (Area de Conservation Guanacaste, ACG) and eastern Andes, Ecuador (centered on Yanayacu Biological Station, YBS). One hundred thirty-six new species of Glyptapanteles Ashmead are described and all of them are authored by Arias-Penna. None of them was recorded in both countries; thus, 78 are from Costa Rica and the remaining 58 from Ecuador. Before this revision, the number of Neotropical described Glyptapanteles did not reach double digits. Reasonable boundaries among species were generated by integrating three datasets: Cytochrome Oxidasc I (COI) gene sequencing data, natural history (host records), and external morphological characters. Each species description is accompanied by images and known geographical distribution. Characteristics such as shape, ornamentation, and location of spun Glyptapanteles cocoons were imaged as well. Host-parasitoid associations and food plants are also here published for the first time. A total of 88 species within 84 genera in 15 Lepidoptera families was encountered as hosts in the field. With respect to food plants, these wild-caught parasitized caterpillars were reared on leaves of 147 species within 118 genera in 60 families. The majority of Glyptapanteles species appeared to be relatively specialized on one family of Lepidoptera or even on some much lower level of taxonomic refinement. Those herbivores in turn are highly food-plant specialized, and once caterpillars were collected, early instars (1-3) yielded more parasitoids than later instars. Glyptapantels jimmilleri Arias-Penna, sp. nov. is the first egg-larval parasitoid recorded within the genus, though there may be many more since such natural history requires a more focused collection of eggs. The rate of hyperparasitoidism within the genus was approximately 4% and was represented by Mesochorus spp. (Ichneumonidae). A single case of multiparasitoidism was reported, Copidosoma floridanum Ash mead (Encyrtidae) and Glyptapanteles ilarisaaksjarvi Arias-Penna, sp. nov. both parasitoid species emerged from the caterpillar of Noctuidae: Condica cupienta (Cramer). Bodyguard behavior was observed in two Glyptapanteles species: G. howelldalyi Arias-Penna, sp. nov. and G. paulhansoni Arias-Penna, sp. nov. A dichotomous key for all the new species is provided. The numerous species described here, and an equal number already reared but not formally described, signal a far greater Glyptapanteles species richness in the Neotropics than suggested by the few described previously.

J	Swanson, DR				Swanson, Daniel R.			Doomed to a vile lot: new taxa, notes, and an updated generic key for the Old World corsairs (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Peiratinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Assassin bugs; systematics; taxonomy	BUGS HEMIPTERA REDUVIIDAE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; TAXONOMIC STATUS; SYSTEMATICS; AUSTRALIA; REVISION; SERVILLE; INSECTA	Herein are erected several new taxa and taxonomic changes based on a study of the Old World genera of Peiratinae: Sphodrembas gen. nov. is erected for a single new species, Sphodrembas fumipennis sp. nov. from Kenya and Tanzania. Ectomocoris caccabatus sp. nov. is newly described and represents the first record of the genus from the Korean Peninsula. Chaulioleistes gen. nov. is erected for Peirates singularis St (a) over circlel, 1874, resulting in Chaulioleistes singularis (St (a) over circlel, 1874) comb. nov. Isdegardes Distant, 1909, described in Acanthaspidinae (=Reduviinae), is considered a junior synonym of the peiratine genus Phalantus St (a) over circlel, 1863 syn. nov., resulting in Phalantus melanocephalus (Distant, 1909) comb. nov. for the type species of Isdegardes. Lestomerus wroughtoni Bergroth, 1915 is transferred to Brachysandalus St (a) over circlel, 1866, resulting in Brachysandalus wroughtoni (Bergroth, 1915) comb. nov. The previously proposed synonymy of Polychitonocoris formosus Miller, 1940 with Calistocoris caesareus Reuter, 1881 is corroborated. All of the above taxonomic acts are supplemented with a key to the species of Calistocoris, a key to the species of Pachysandalus, and a key to the peiratine genera of the Old World. Also reported are thirteen new country records for eleven other species: Brachysandalus bicolor (Villiers, 1948) (Kenya, Tanzania); Ectomocoris bimaculatus Schouteden, 1909 (Ghana); Ectomocoris fenestratus (Klug, 1830) (Ghana); Ectomocoris maculicrus (Fairmaire, 1858) (Uganda, Zimbabwe); Lestomerus affinis (Audinet-Serville, 1831) (Malaysia); Lestomerus basilewskyi Villiers, 1962 (Kenya); Lestomerus bicolor (Villiers, 1948) (Kenya); Lestomerus dubius Villiers, 1948 (Cameroon); Pachysandalus schoutedeni Villiers, 1962 (Sudan); Peirates collarti Schouteden, 1931 (Cameroon); Peirates quadrinotatus (Fabricius, 1798) (Malaysia); and Phalantus africanus St (a) over circlel, 1874 (Ghana).

J	Nokkala, C; Kuznetsova, V; Rinne, V; Nokkala, S				Nokkala, Christina; Kuznetsova, Valentina; Rinne, Veikko; Nokkala, Seppo			Description of two new species of the genus Cacopsylla Ossiannilsson, 1970 (Hemiptera, Psylloidea) from northern Fennoscandia recognized by morphology, cytogenetic characters and COI barcode sequence	COMPARATIVE CYTOGENETICS			English	Article						Cacopsylla; COI; karyotype; morphology; new species; Northern Europe; bisexual reproduction; parthenogenesis	RARE MALES; POPULATIONS; WAGNER	Based on chromosomal, molecular and morphological analyses, two new Cacopsylla Ossiannilsson, 1970 species are described, C. lapponica S. Nokkala & Ch. Nokkala, sp. nov. and C. borealis S. Nokkala et Ch. Nokkala, sp. nov. (Hemiptera, Psylloidea). C. lapponica is a rare bisexual alpine species living on Vaccinium uliginosum Linnaeus, 1753 above tree line on northern hills, where it forms sympatric populations with C. myrtilli W. Wagner, 1947. So far, the species has been found in northern Finland, Utsjoki and Kilpisjarvi, and in northern Sweden, Abisko. The chromosome number in males is 2n = 12+X(0), characteristic of psyllids. The species is easily distinguished from C. myrtilli by its conspicuously smaller size mainly due to difference in wing size. Additional morphological differences are found in the length of antennae, female genital plates and male parameres. C. borealis, in turn, is a relatively common apomictic parthenogenetic species with 5n = 60 + XXXXX living on the same host plant, Ledum palustre Linnaeus, 1753, as C. ledi (Flor, 1861) and occasionally forming sympatric populations with it. No males have been recorded in C. borealis. Its distribution range reaches at least from northern Fennoscandia to Lake Baikal in the East. C. borealis can be distinguished from C. ledi by differences in the length and width of antennae, dark brown markings on the wing and female terminal structures. For molecular analysis, a 638 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced. C. lapponica differs from the cohabitating C. myrtilli by 20 fixed nucleotide substitutions (uncor rected p-distance 3.13 %), while C. borealis differs from C. ledi by 21 fixed nucleotide substitutions (uncorrected p-distance 3.29 %). Molecular phylogeny construction (ML and BI) reveals two highly divergent clades, one comprising two bisexual species, C. lapponica and C. fraudatrix Labina & Kuznetsova, 2012, and the other clade comprising the parthenogenetic species C. borealis, C. myrtilli, and C. ledi. Within this clade, C. borealis is more closely associated with C. myrtilli than with C. ledi.

There have been no new species of these two genera described for the Northeast Pacific since Laubenfels' work in central California (Laubenfels 1930, 1932) and Lambe's reports in 1893 to 1895 for Geological Survey of Canada sponge collections from British Columbia, Canada to the Bering Sea. We describe three new species of Lissodendoryx (Lissodendoryx) (Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida, Coelosphaeridae) and one new species of Myxilla (Myxilla) (Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida, Myxillidae): L. (L.) barkleyensis n. sp., L. (L.) littoralis n. sp., L. (L.) toxaraphida n. sp. and M. (M.) austini n. sp. Lissodendoryx (L.) barkleyensis n. sp. is cave-dwelling, has acanthostyles 112-260 mu m, tornotes 107-177 mu m, arcuate isochelas 8-28 mu m and two sizes of sigmas 18-29, 26-55 mu m. Lissodendoryx (L.) littoralis n. sp. fistulate habitus is adapted to muddy substrates similar to some Polymastia species also found commonly in the Northeast Pacific. It has subtylostyles 185-336 mu m, tylotes 112-229 mu m, arcuate isochelas 11-23 mu m, and sigmas 30-75 mu m. Lissodendoryx (L.) toxaraphida n. sp. is the only described Lissodendoryx species with raphides shaped like toxas. It has acanthostyles 140-286 mu m, tornotes 143-195 mu m, arcuate isochelas 18-34 mu m and toxiform raphides 65-156 mu m. Myxilla (M.) austini n. sp. has a fistulate habitus and both tornote and tylote megascleres. It appears to be tolerant of low oxygen environments. Myxilla (M.) austini n. sp. has smooth to sparsely spined styles 193-353 mu m, tylotes 153-221 mu m, tornotes 174-260 mu m, two sizes of anchorate isochelas 13-27, 42-81 mu m, and two sizes of sigmas 13-47, 33-78 mu m.

New genus, new species and new records of marine acotylean flatworms (Platyhelminthes: Polycladida: Acotylea) from Oaxaca, southern Mexican Pacific	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Bisacculosuteri gen. nov.; Bivesiculoplana; Euplanoida; histological approach; Paraplanocera	BIODIVERSITY; TURBELLARIA; COAST	The acotylean polyclads are characterized by the absence of a ventral sucker located posteriorly to the female gonopore. These flatworms are mostly marine, benthic or pelagic, except by two species, one freshwater Limnostylochus borneensis and other semi-terrestrial Myoramyxa pardalota. Oaxaca is a state located in the southern Mexican Pacific, where only three acotyleans species have been formally recorded until now. After sampling littoral to sublittoral zones, a total of 34 specimens were collected and fixed in frozen formalin. Some specimens were stained with Mayer's carmalum and hematoxylin and cleared in methyl salicylate for whole mounts; the portion containing the reproductive structures of other specimens were dissected and histologically processed in sagittal and frontal sections. Four species were identified as belonging to four genera and three families. The new genus Bisacculosuteri gen. nov. is established, close to the genus Itannia, but lacking double ventral suckers placed on both sides of the female gonopore. Two species are new to science: Bisacculosuteri marcelae sp. nov., characterized by a highly branched central pharynx, prominent seminal vesicle, a penis papilla with stylet, paired strongly muscularized uterine sac and uterine vesicles; and Paraplanocera oligoglenoides sp. nov., with translucent body, light brown pigmentation and black dots distributed in the pharyngeal and reproductive regions, and an oval cirrus sac with intramuscular surrounding hollow spaces and armored with spines and conspicuous teeth. The third species is Euplanoida cf. pacificola that could not be determined as the nominal species, due to ambiguity in its description. The fourth species, Bivesiculoplana lamothei, was previously described from the region and now is recorded in new localities and hosts from Oaxaca.

A new species of Ungla (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) that exhibits remarkable homoplasy in male secondary sexual characters	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Meleoma; green lacewing; frontal horns; cranial modifications; abdominal and genital characters		A new and very unusual species of green lacewings, Ungla pseudomeleoma sp. nov. is described from Peru. Males of this species exhibit a remarkable example of generic-level homoplasy with Meleoma. Its abdominal and genitalic features are completely consistent with the genus Ungla. However, its external sexually dimorphic features resemble those of both Ungla and Meleoma. Females of the new species also express cranial modifications that resemble those of some female Meleoma species.

A comprehensive revision of the Neotropical species is presented based on the examination of >150 specimens, the phylogenetic analysis of the entire subfamily based on 47 morphological characters, and the description of eight new species from Southeastern Brazil. The Aphilodontinae were confirmed a monophyletic clade within Geophilidae and closely related to Geoperingueyia, with which they share synapomorphic characters in the labrum, second maxillae and forcipules. Particular groups of clypeal setae, inconspicuous lateral parts of labrum and coalescent forcipular throchanteroprefemur and femur were recovered as synapomorphies of the Aphilodontinae. Four monophyletic genera are recognized within the subfamily Aphilodontinae Silvestri, 1909 (1908) (= Brasilophilidae Verhoeff, 1908; = Mecistaucheninae Verhoeff, 1925 n. syn.), three exclusively Neotropical and one exclusively South African. The Neotropical genera are: Aphilodon Silvestri, 1898 (= Mecistauchenus Brolemann, 1907 n. syn.; = Brasilophilus Verhoeff, 1908 n. syn.), with ten species (including A. caboclos n. sp., A. indespectus n. sp., A. meganae n. sp., A. pereirai n. sp. and A. silvestrii n. sp.), characterized by a small terminal spine on the ultimate legs, in both males and females; Mecophilus Silvestri, 1909, with two species (including M. tupiniquim n. sp.), characterized by elongated forcipular segment and first leg-bearing segment; Mairata n. gen., with two species (M. butantan n. sp. and M. itatiaiensis n. sp.), characterized by the partial reduction of the distal article of the second maxillary telopodite and a particular shape of ultimate legs, in both males and females. The South African genus, Philacroterium Attems, 1926, comprises eleven known species (including P. weberi (Silvestri, 1909) n. comb., P. caffrarium (Verhoeff, 1937) n. comb., P. porosum (Verhoeff, 1937) n. comb., P. brevipes (Verhoeff, 1938) n. comb., P. bidentatum (Lawrence, 1955) n. comb., P. longipes (Lawrence, 1955) n. comb., P. macronyx (Lawrence, 1955) n. comb., P. maritimum (Lawrence, 1963) n. comb., P. pauciporum (Lawrence, 1963) n. comb. and P. transvaalicum (Lawrence, 1963) n. comb.) and is characterized by vestigial lateral parts of the labrum and the complete suppression of the distal article of the telopodites of the second maxillae. Identification keys are provided for the Aphilodontinae genera and for the species of Aphilodon, Mecophilus and Mairata n. gen. The known occurrence of Aphilodon in Brazil is extended from the states of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso to the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, that of Mecophilus from the state of Parana to the state of Sao Paulo.

Examination of this new species and re-examination of previously described species revealed that the separation of the subgenus Glyptolaccobius Gentili, 1989 and Cyclolaeeobius Gentili, 1991 is artificial: both subgenera are hence combined here. Cyclolaccobius syn. nov. is synonymized with Glyptolaccobius, and the latter is shown to be diagnosed by 7-segmented antennae as a unique synapomorphy. All species treated until now under Cyclolaccobius arc here transferred to Glyptolaccobius, with the only exception of L. hingstoni Orchymont, 1926, L. jumlanus Gentili, 2015 and L. zugmayeri Knisch, 1910 which are tentatively transferred to the subgenus Hydsoxenus Wollaston, 1867, as their antennae bear eight antennomeres. Three species are recorded for the first time from China: L. (Microlaccobius) orientalis Knisch, 1924 from Xizang, Laccobius (M.) exilis Gentili,1974 from Xinjiang, and Laccobius (M.) sublaevis J. Sahlberg, 1900 from Xinjiang. Additional faunistic data from China are provided for the following species: L.

One new species, Copelatus martinbaehri sp. nov., is described from Papua New Guinea (Central Province) and Cape York Peninsula (Iron Range NP and Mt Tozer). Copelatus divisus Watts, 1978, syn. nov., is considered a junior synonym of C. portior Guignot, 1956, described from New Guinea. Species delimitation is based on the morphological characters and Cox1 data. All species are (re)described, and their important species characters (median lobes, parameres, habitus and colour patterns) are illustrated. A key to all nine species is provided. The known distribution and habitat preferences of each species are outlined briefly. In Australia, all nine species are distributed in the northern half of the continent. Four species are also reported from New Guinea: in addition to C. martinbaehri sp. nov., we record C. clarki Sharp, 1882 for the first time from southern New Guinea, and consider literature records of C. irregularis W.J. Macleay, 1871 and C. marginatus Sharp, 1882 from New Guinea as doubtful. Copelatus portior is widely distributed in Australasia, while C. tenebrosus is widely distributed in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. All Australian Copelatus are confirmed to be lentic, found in a large variety of stagnant water, mainly in lowland areas up to 250 m.

Redescription of the 'older Adelopsis' species (Coleoptera: Leiodidae: Cholevinae: Ptomaphagini) based on the analysis of type specimens	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Coleoptera; Cholevinae; Adelopsis; Paulipalpina; Parapaulipalpina	ARGENTINA COLEOPTERA; RECORDS; LEVEL; PERU	As preparation for a revision of the Neotropical genera Adelopsis Portevin, 1907, Paulipalpina Gnaspini and Peck, 1996, and Parapaulipalpina Gnaspini, 1996, we review and redescribe the earlier named species and code characters of their genitalia. These characters are then used to redefine species groups. We review the following 22 "older" species: Adelopsis ascutellaris (Murray, 1856) (male lectotype here designated); Adelopsis aspera Jeannel, 1936; Adelopsis asperoides Szymczakowski, 1963; Adelopsis azzalii Szymczakowski, 1975 (here raised to specific status-previously as Adelopsis brunnea azzalii); Adelopsis bellator Szymczakowski, 1968; Adelopsis benardi (Portevin, 1923); Adelopsis brasiliensis Jeannel, 1936; Adelopsis brevicollis Szymczakowski, 1975 (here raised to specific status-previously as Adelopsis brunnea brevicollis); Adelopsis bruchi (Pic, 1926) (male lectotype here designated); Adelopsis darwini Jeannel, 1936; Adelopsis grouvellei Jeannel, 1936; Adelopsis heterocera Portevin, 1907 (the type species of Adelopsis, here considered a junior synonym of Adelopsis ruficollis (Portevin, 1903)); Adelopsis insolita Szymczakowski, 1961; Adelopsis luculenta Szymczakowski, 1963; Adelopsis orcina Szymczakowski, 1975 (here raised to specific status-previously as Adelopsis brunnea orcina); Adelopsis ovalis Jeannel, 1936; Adelopsis pteromoria Szymczakowski, 1975 (here raised to specific status-previously as Adelopsis brunnea pteromoria); Adelopsis ruficollis (Portevin, 1903) (male lectotype here designated) (here considered a senior synonym of Adelopsis heterocera Portevin, 1907); Adelopsis triangulifer Szymczakowski, 1961; Parapaulipalpina filicornis (Jeannel, 1936); Paulipalpina dispar (Portevin, 1903) (male lectotype here designated); and Paulipalpina simoni (Portevin, 1903). The status of Adelopsis brunnea Jeannel, 1936 is discussed, and is restricted to a single, nominal subspecies. Specific status is restablished for Adelopsis linaresi Szymczakowski, 1969 (previously as Adelopsis brunnea linaresi). The status of Paulipalpina claudicans (Szymczakowski, 1980) is discussed. To correct published misidentifications in museum collections, we also describe the following nine new species: Adelopsis claudina sp. n., Adelopsis mrazi sp. n., Adelopsis szymczakowskii sp. n., Adelopsis waclawi sp. n., and Paulipalpina jeanneli sp. n. (all from Brazil), Paulipalpina consuelo sp. n. from Peru, Adelopsis portevini sp. n. and Paulipalpina aragua sp. n. from Venezuela, and Paulipalpina coatepec sp. n. from Mexico. Iutururuca Gnaspini, 1993, described as a subgenus of Adelopsis, is here considered a junior synonym of Adelopsis Portevin, 1907, which is defined as having no subgenera.

N.; Butcher, Buntika			Molecular phylogeny places the enigmatic subfamily Masoninae within the Ichneumonidae, not the Braconidae	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						Braconidae; Ichneumonidae; Masona; Masoninae; molecular phylogenetic analysis	HYMENOPTERA ICHNEUMONOIDEA; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; LIFE-HISTORY; ALIGNMENT; INSECTA; WASPS; 28S	The Masoninae (type genus Masona van Achterberg) is a widespread but seldom collected group of morphologically aberrant tiny (body length 2 mm or less) wasps that have always been considered as a subfamily of Braconidae, albeit on little supporting evidence. Discovery of a fully winged female of Masona from remote Australia has enabled a reassessment of its relationships. This specimen yielded sequence data for the nuclear 28S and 18S rDNA genes, the barcoding fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene. These were analysed separately and together, along with representatives of Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. Maximum likelihood analyses of all four genes separately and combined concur that Masona is nested within the Ichneumonidae and, therefore, is not a member of Braconidae. This is also supported by the position of the sternaulus low on mesopleuron, absence of fore wing vein (RS + M)a (though the great reduction in wing venation makes further interpretation problematic) and the articulated junction of metasomal tergites 2 and 3. On balance, molecular analyses place Masona basally among the ophioniformes lineage of Ichneumonidae. Formal description of the Australian species as Masona timpaynei Quicke sp. n. and a revised diagnosis of Masoninae are provided in S1 together with illustration of the holotype.	[Quicke, Donald L.

Diversity and distribution of Pleioplectron Hutton cave weta (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae: Macropathinae), with the synonymy of Weta Chopard and the description of seven new species	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Cave weta; Pleioplectron; Rhaphidophoridae; systematics; New Zealand	MITOCHONDRIAL; SEQUENCES	The genus Pleioplectron was first described by Hutton (1896) and included six New Zealand species. This genus has since had three species moved, one each to the genera Pachyrhamma Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1888, Miotopus Hutton, 1898 and Novoplectron Richards, 1958. Here we clarify the status and appearance of Pleioplectron simplex Hutton, 1896 (incl. P. pectinatum Hutton, 1896 syn. nov.) and P. hudsoni Hutton, 1896, as well as P. thomsoni (Chopard, 1923) comb. nov., which is transferred from the genus Weta Chopard, 1923. The genus Weta is newly synonymised with Pleioplectron. We also describe seven new species of Pleioplectron from South Island, New Zealand: P. auratum sp. nov., P. caudatum sp. nov, P. crystallae sp. nov., P. flavicorne sp. nov., P. gubernator sp. nov., P. rodmorrisi sp. nov and P. triquetrum sp. nov. We base these descriptions on morphology using fresh specimens of both male and female adults, and provide support for each with DNA sequence variation (mtDNA, partial COI).

A Case Study with the Description of Milnesium pseudotardigradum sp. nov. (Tardigrada) with Unique Developmental Variability	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES			English	Article						Cryptic species; Developmental variability; Ontogeny; Pseudocrypsis; Species distribution	EUTARDIGRADA APOCHELA MILNESIIDAE; INTEGRATIVE DESCRIPTION; ANNOTATED ZOOGEOGRAPHY; REDESCRIPTION; MACROBIOTIDAE; DIVERSITY; FAMILY; KANSAS; DOYERE; GENUS	The tardigrade fauna of Iceland has been a subject of studies since mid XX century. So far, only a single species of the genus Milnesium has been reported from the island, M. tardigradum, which at the time was assumed to have a cosmopolitan distribution. However, the record comes from before the redescription of M. tardigradum, thus the validity of the Icelandic report is questionable. Some species of Milnesium are characterised by developmental variability, which is most pronounced in the morphology of secondary branches of claws, exhibited by shifts in the number of spurs. In this contribution, we present a case study in which multiple claw configurations (CC) were found in a single lichen sample from Iceland, indicating the presence of more than one species and/or ontogenetic variability. To elucidate this puzzle, we utilised a range of integrative tools, including detailed morphology, morphometry, barcoding and development tracking. We present the workflow, which enabled us to collect the data for each species/morphotype. In result, we revealed the presence of three species, two characterised by ontogenetic CC change (M. variefidum and a new species) and one with a stable CC (a new species). Here, we describe one of these new species, M. pseudotardigradum, which is extremely similar to M. tardigradum, but can be phenotypically differentiated by a unique, double CC change pattern.

In this paper, a taxonomic revision of the genus Heptathela (Heptathelinae) from Kyushu and Ryukyu archipelago, Japan is provided. This study follows a multi-tier species delimitation strategy within an integrative taxonomic framework that is presented in a parallel paper, in which diagnosable lineages are considered as valid species. There, the initial hypothesis of species diversity (19) based on classical morphological diagnoses is tested with multiple species delimitation methods aimed at resolving conflict in data. This revision follows those analyses that converge on the species diversity of 20, which includes a pair of cryptic species that would have been undetected with morphology alone. After this revision, eight previously described species remain valid, two junior synonyms are proposed, and 12 new Heptathela species are described based on diagnostic evidence. To ease identification and to hint at putative evolutionary units, Heptathela is divided into three groups. The Kyushu group contains H. higoensis Haupt, 1983, H. kikuyai Ono, 1998, H. kimurai (Kishida, 1920), and H. yakushimaensis Ono, 1998; the Amami group contains H. amamiensis Haupt, 1983, H. kanenoi Ono, 1996, H. kojima sp. nov., H. sumiyo sp. nov., and H. uken sp. nov.; and the Okinawa group contains H. yanbaruensis Haupt, 1983, H. aha sp. nov., H. gayozan sp. nov., H. kubayama sp. nov., H. mae sp. nov., H. otoha sp. nov., H. shuri sp. nov., H. tokashiki sp. nov., H. unten sp. nov., and H. crypta sp. nov. Heptathela helios Tanikawa & Miyashita, 2014 is not assigned to a species group. A combination of diagnostic tools augments the morphological diagnoses that, in isolation, would be prone to error in morphologically challenging groups of organisms.

All seven species discovered on Tanimbar are new to science, and described here: Trigonopterus atuf sp. nov., T. kumbang sp. nov., T. laratensis sp. nov., T. porg sp. nov., T. selaruensis sp. nov., T. tanimbarensis sp. nov., and T. triradiatus sp. nov. The new species are authored by the taxonomists-in-charge, Raden Pramesa Narakusumo and Alexander Riedel. This fauna appears discordant and established by relatively recent dispersal from New Guinea and other Moluccan islands.

In this paper, Ceraeochrysa tacanensis sp. nov. is described and illustrated from Volcan Tacana, Chiapas, and an identification key to Ceraeochrysa species present in Mexico is provided. The new species is similar to others with swollen and darkened posterior branches of the cubital vein, and it can be separated from these other species by an elongate gonapsis extending from the base of the gonosaccus; the gonapsis is slightly upturned, terminating in a rounded apex with dorsal microteeth. Females of the new species have non-distinctive genitalia morphology. However, they can be associated with males of the species by body color pattern, synchrony, and sympatry.

The fourteenth species recorded of this genus, Acanthosaura tongbiguanensis sp. nov., was previously considered A. lepidogaster although it more closely resembles A. crucigera. It can be separated from all other species of the genus by having different numbers of subdigital lamellae on the fourth finger and toe, and a different shape of the black eye patch. The new species differs genetically from investigated congeners by percentage distance of 14.46% to 23.27% (cytochrome b gene).

J	Wang, L; Deng, XJ; Liu, Y; Wu, QQ; Liu, Z				Wang, Lu; Deng, Xuejian; Liu, Yong; Wu, Qianqian; Liu, Zhao			A new species of the genus Megophrys (Amphibia: Anura: Megophryidae) from Hunan, China	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Megophryidae; Megophrys shunhuangensis sp. nov.; new species; Southern China	PROVINCE; COLLECTION; XENOPHRYS; DIVERSITY; GUANGDONG; REVISION; TOADS; FROGS	We describe a new species of Megophryidae frog, Megophrys shunhuangensis sp. nov., from Hunan Province, Southern China. It can be distinguished from other known species in the subgenus Panophrys by morphological characters, bioacoustic data and a molecular divergence in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene similar to that found among other species of Panophrys. M. shunhuangensis sp. nov. is characterized by a relatively small body size, with adult females measuring 37.6 mm and adult males measuring 30.3-33.6 mm in snout to vent length; maxillary teeth present, vomerine teeth absent, tongue smooth, not notched behind; hindlimb slender, heels overlapping, tibio-tarsal articulation reaches forward between the nasal and tip of snout. Molecular phylogenetic analyses also show that M. sp. 6 from (Mao'er Shan, China) from Chen et al. (2017) and M. sp. 24 (Anjiangping and Mao'er Shan, China) from Liu et al. (2018) may be the same species as M. shunhuangensis sp. nov., we consequently speculate that the new species also distributed in Anjiangping and Mao'er Shan, China. At present, the genus .Megophrys contains 85 species of which 48 species are distributed in China, and 30 belong to the subgenus Panophrys.

(Polycystididae) and Trigonostomum sinensis n. sp. (Trigonostomidae), were discovered from the intertidal zone of eastern Shenzhcn City, China. For A. sinensis n. sp., the stylet consists of two symmetrical triangular plates and one lamellar plate. All three plates are jagged at their posterior ends. The anterior end of the stylet connects to a thick muscular layer, which causes its movement. For T sinensis n. sp., the copulatory organ consists of a long-tubular sty let and two "T"-shaped plates (plate I and plate II). The sty let bends 120 degrees at 25% of its length from the base and extends straight distally. Two "T" plates are connected to each other and surround the stylet. Plate I is hook-shaped at its distal end, and plate II has a similar length but only half the width of plate I. The phylogenetic (18S rDNA and 28S rDNA) results also support the establishment of these two new species. On the basis of the molecular phylogeny and morphology of the copulatory organ and bursa appendage, we propose a new categorization of the species of Trigonostomum.

Two additional species of the genus which remain undescribed are briefly diagnosed. The material was collected during Taxon Expeditions' field course which involved citizen scientists, students and taxonomists. Specimens were collected at altitudes between 270 m and 750 m above sea level using fine-meshed hand-nets and blacklight traps. The morphological species delimitation based on morphology was supplemented and congruent with mtDNA sequences which are the first DNA barcodes for the genus from Borneo. They were obtained in the field using a newly developed rapid and accurate MinION-based workflow. The inter - and intraspecific genetic distances and the problems regarding cryptic species delimitation are discussed.

Caridina biyiga sp. nov., a new freshwater shrimp (Crustacea: Decapoda: Atyidae) from Leichhardt Springs, Kakadu National Park, Australia, based on morphological and molecular data, with a preliminary illustrated key to Northern Territory Caridina	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						taxonomy; systematics; DNA; phylogeny; genetics; new species; thermal springs	COLONIZATION; PHYLOGENY; REVISION; PACIFIC; CALMAN; ISLAND; WORLD	Caridina biyiga sp. nov. is described from Leichhardt Springs, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, based on morphological and molecular data. The new species is highly distinctive among its congeners in having the dactylus of pereiopod 5 similar to the dactyli of pereiopods 3-4 and lacking the comb-like row of spiniform setae typical of the genus. The branchial formula is also distinctive for the genus in lacking an arthrobranch at the base of pereiopod 1 and in having a vestigial epipod on maxilliped 1. Despite the distinctive morphology of the new species, the molecular data did not provide strong support for the recognition of a new genus. Phylogenetic analyses of Australian Caridina using the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene fragment placed the new species in a well-supported Glade containing at least one typical species of Caridina. Within this Glade, referred to as the 'thermophila' group, Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) genetic distances of 16S rDNA between the new species and sister taxa ranged from 5.1-6.0%. Analyses using the mitochondrial 3' COI gene fragment from species of the 'thermophila' group yielded K2P genetic distances between the new species and its sister taxa ranging from 10.4-15.1%. A preliminary illustrated key to Northern Territory Caridina is provided. The conservation significance of Leichhardt Springs and its aquatic fauna are also briefly discussed.

For almost 100 years Calcinus tibicen (Herbst, 1791) was the only hermit crab species known from TMV. From 2012 to 2018, 263 daytime SCUBA diving and intertidal samplings conducted at TMV yielded 1075 paguroid specimens in 10 species, three of which are established herein as new species: Iridopagurus martinvaz sp. nov., Nematopagurus micheleae sp. nov., and Pagurus carmineus sp. nov. Iridopagurus margaritensis Garcia-Gomez, 1983, and Phimochirus leurocarpus McLaughlin, 1981, both only known from the northern hemisphere, are recorded for the first time from the southwestern Atlantic. Opportunity was taken herein to include hitherto unreported or little known specimens from along the Vitoria-Trindade Seamount Chain, namely, Dardanus venosus H. Milne Edwards, 1848, Nematopaguroides pusillus Forest & de Saint Laurent, 1968, Pagurus provenzanoi Forest & de Saint Laurent, 1968, and Phimochirus holthuisi (Provenzano, 1961). The lectotype of Pagurus venosus H. Milne Edwards, 1848 is designated as the neotype for the obscure Pagurus arrosor divergens Moreira, 1905, which thus becomes an objective junior synonym of the former. A list of all paguroid species known from the tropical southern-central Atlantic oceanic archipelagoes and islands (Ascension, Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha, Gulf of Guinea. Rocas Atoll, Saint Helena, Trindade and Martin Vaz) with their gross distribution in the Atlantic Ocean is provided. Investigation on the existence of patterns of geographic distribution for the paguroid fauna of the tropical southern-central Atlantic oceanic islands showed that 70% percent of the paguroids from TMV are western Atlantic in origin and 30% endemic. No amphi-Atlantic paguroid species are known from TMV. Conversely, the affinity of Ascension's (33%) and Saint Helena's (50%) paguroids is with the eastern Atlantic; no western Atlantic paguroids have been reported from these two islands so far. Exploration on the existence of trends of correlation between islands area and species richness through the Spe 's coefficient of correlation showed that the patterns in the number of paguroid species cannot be explained by variation in island area alone (r(s) = 0.4728; p = 0.28571).

Among them, Exiliphotic petila sp. nov. is a monotype of the newly reported Exiliphotis gen. nov., which is characterized by slenderer and more elongate pereopods 5-7 than those of other genera of the family Photidae. The genus Latigammaropsis is reported for the first time from Korean waters based on the description of Latigammaropsis careocavata sp. nov., which is differentiated from other Gammaropsis group by having weakly sexual dimorphic gnathopods 2, those have simple palmar margins in both sexes. Three new species of Photis are also described: Photis bronca sp. nov., Photis posterolobus sp. nov., and Photis longicarpus sp. nov. The formerly misidentified Photis longicaudata from Japan and China as well as the Korean material could be classified as a new species, P. bronca sp. nov. For that, the syntypes of P. longicaudata were re-examined, and lectotype and paralectotypes were newly designated in this study. Photis bronca sp. nov. is characterized by quadrate tooth on the palmar margin medially on gnathopod 2 in both sexes. Photis posterolobus sp. nov. shows a pointed posterior lobe on the ischium and a well-developed process of the propodus on male gnathopod 2. Photis longicarpus sp. nov. can be distinguished from other species of the genus by very elongate carpus of male gnathopod 1. Two new species belonging to the genus Podoceropsis are also reported: Podoceropsis insinuomanus sp. nov. has a strongly bisinuous palmar margin on male gnathopod 2, and Podoceropsis pseudoclavapes sp. nov. differs from the closely related species of Podoceropsis clavapes by different shape of the palmar margin and shorter dactylus of male gnathopod 2. Additionally, a key to the Korean species of Photidac is provided.

Revision of the Australian planthopper genus Chidaea Emeljanov with a redescription of Cixius sidnicus Stal, 1859 (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha: Fulgoromorpha: Cixiidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Australia; identification; morphology; distribution; Cicadina; Fulgoroidea; endemic planthopper	TAXONOMIC REVISION; AGENT	As part of the ongoing revision of the Australian Cixiidae, here we revise the endemic genus Chidaea Emeljanov, 2000. Examination of the holotype of Cixius sidnicus Stal, 1859 revealed that it is not congeneric with Cixius nervosus (Linnaeus, 1758) but belongs to the hitherto monotypic genus Chidaea resulting in the new combination Chidaea sidnicus (Stal, 1859). Chidaea dayi Emeljanov, 2000 is redescribed and thirteen new species are described: Chidaea algida sp. nov., Ch. armidalensis sp. nov., Ch. belairensis sp. nov., Ch. bobadeenensis sp. nov., Ch. carinala sp. nov., Ch. crassa sp. nov., Ch. dickinsonorum sp. nov., Ch. etelis sp. nov., Ch. kimbaensis sp. nov., Ch. orangensis sp. nov., Ch. pulyonna sp. nov., Ch. punctata sp. nov., and Ch. wilarra sp. nov. An identification key to species of Chidaea and to Australian genera of Cixiini is presented. Host plant relationships and distribution are discussed. Chidaea is endemic to Australia and occurs in all states and territories apart from the Northern Territory.

A cladistic analysis of the genus was performed using these two new species plus the three previously described species of the genus [P. fuscopictus (B. Soares, 1942); P. otguensis (Soares & Soares, 1954); and P striatus (Roewer, 1913)], and 25 more additional gonyleptoid outgroup species, most being representatives of the K92 Glade. The data matrix is composed of 109 characters: three from the ocularium, 24 from the dorsal scutum, six from the free tergites, nine from the pedipalp, 41 from the legs and 26 from male genitalia. The genus Progonyleptoidellus was recovered as monophyletic only with the exclusion of P. orguensis and was supported on the basis of only one exclusive synapomorphy: presence of dry-marks on sulci of dorsal scutum. Based on the cladistic analysis, P. orguensis was reallocated in Deltaspidium Roewer, 1927, herein considered a senior synonym of Adhynastes Roewer, 1930, and two new combinations are proposed: Deltaspidium orguense (Soares & Soares, 1954) and Deltaspidium tenue (Roewer, 1930). Diagnoses are given for Progonyleptoidellus, the previously described species, (P. fuscopictus and P. striatus) and the two new species.

In the present paper, an update of the reported Mexican tardigrades is presented, increasing the number of recorded tardigrades to 55 species (11 new records). Moreover, we describe Milnesium cassandrae sp. nov. from State of Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico. The new species is most similar to Mil. krzysztofi Kaczmarek & Michalczyk, 2007 and Mil. beasleyi Kaczmarek, Jakubowska & Michalczyk, 2012, but it differs from them mainly by details of the dorsal sculpture and some morphometric characters. We also discuss the taxonomic value of a recently described feature, 'pseudoplates', for differentiating the taxa within the genus Milnesium Doyere, 1840.

Deronectes kabilcevz sp. n. belongs to the D. longipes-subgroup of the D. parvicollis-group. It is externally similar to the other members of this subgroup, but can be separated by the different shape of the median lobe of aedeagus. Deronectes propedoriae sp. n. belongs to the D. doriae-group. Analysis of molecular studies suggests that the new species and D. doriae Sharp, 1882 are closely related but undoubtedly different with an uncorrected p distance of 7% in the cytochrome oxydase gene. Also external characters allow an easy separation although only the female holotype of the new species is known-the pronotum and the last abdominal ventrite of each have very different shapes. The habitus, the genitalia and other features of the species are illustrated. The keys to species of the respective groups of genus Deronectes are updated. Including the results of this study, 61 species of Deronectes are now known.

The new species presents traits shared with both Croscherichia and desert species of the genus Ammabris, making it morphologically singular. Conspicuous external similarities (coloration pattern, shape of the mandibles, setation) between C. armass sp. nov. and Ammabris allow the two to be easily confused. However, C. al-nubs sp. nov. can be readily distinguished from all other Croscherichia species by the following traits: reddish-orange legs with dark tarsi; relatively short black antennae with the proximal-most three to four antennomeres of each antenna having a reddish-brown coloration; dense and silvery body setation that lies over most of the body integument; straight and pointed outer mandible margins that protrude from the labrum; a mesosternum with an angulate anterior margin; a short, subcylindrical, and weakly spatulate external metatibial spur that is truncated obliquely at the apex. Croscherichia armass sp. nov. is only known from three localities in the arid Hammada steppes, which are located within the Quaternary alluvial plains of the Muluya river valley. Live specimens of C. armass sp. nov. were found in flight and actively feeding on Atriplex halimus (Chenopodiaceae) flowers at the end of summer (mid-September). The phenology of C. armass sp. nov. is exceptional as no other Mylabrini species known from eastern areas of Morocco are active in late summer.

Gongga; Sichuan; China	COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; MOTHS LEPIDOPTERA; GHOST-MOTHS; INSECT; GENETICS; RADSEQ	A new species of ghost moth, Thitarodes shambalaensis sp. nov., is described from Yanzigou glacier, Mt. Gongga, Sichuan, China. The species is a host of the economically important caterpillar fungus Ophiacordyceps sinensis. Establishment of this new species is supported by morphology and genetic differentiation measured in a CO1 phylogeny and in genomc-wide SNP coverage. A summary tree from 538 sequences of different genetic markers from Thitarodes (including sequences extracted from caterpillar fungus sclerotium samples) support the genus Thitarodes as a monophyletic group, and indicate that 7hitarodes is the host genus for O. sinensis. Sampling efforts so far have centered on half of the known phylogenetic diversity of Thitarodes, with some species-level clusters (separated by < 2.5% genetic distance) containing 17 described species. Fifteen clusters arc known from either a single "orphan taxon" or a single sequence from a caterpillar fungus sclerotiuni sample. We provide suggestions for building a more robust phylogeny of the genus Thitarodes and highlight some of the conservation threats that species from this genus face due to unprecedented habitat exploitation.

Herein, an extensive taxonomic review of Procercopidae is presented and some new fossils are reported from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of NE China. As a result, Chengdecercopis Hong, 1983 is transferred from Procercopidae to Sinoalidae; Procercopis longipennis Becker-Migdisova, 1962 and P shawanensis Zhang, Wang and Zhang, 2003 are transferred to Procercopina Martynov, 1937, resulting in Procercopina longipennis (Becker-Migdisova, 1962), comb. n. and P shawanensis (Zhang, Wang and Zhang, 2003), comb. n.; Luanpingia senjituensis Hong, 1984 is transferred to Stellularis Chen, Yao and Ren, 2015, leading to Stellulari senjituensis (Hong, 1984), comb. n.; Anthoscytina macula Hu, Yao and Ren, 2014 is transferred to Sinocercopis Hong, 1982, and Sunoscytinopteris (Scytinopteridae) and Cathaycixius (Cixiidae) are treated as junior homonym names of Sinocercopis, leading to Sinocercopis macula (Hu, Yao and Ren, 2014), comb. n., S lushangfenensis (Hong, 1984), comb. n., S pustulosis (Ren, 1995), comb. n., and S trinervis (Ren, 1995), comb. n. Additionally, two new species are erected: Stellularis bineuris Chen and Wang, sp. n. and S minutus Chen and Wang, sp. n. Our cladistic analysis based on wing (tegmen and hind wing) characteristics recovers the high-level relationships within Cercopoidea: Sinoalidae + (Procercopidae + (Cercopionidae + modern cercopoids)). Within the family Procercopidae, the cladistic analysis reveals that the Middle to Late Jurassic Titanocercopis and Jurocercopis and the Cretaceous Cretocercopis occupy the basal position, and a gradual change in wing venation can be recognized from the Early Jurassic Procercopis and Procercopina to the Jurassic Anthoscytina, and then to the Cretaceous Stellularis and Sinocercopis. The two Cretaceous genera, sharing wing traits with extant cercopoids, likely represent transitional forms between Procercopidae and recent Cercopoidea; however, they are very similar to their Jurassic relatives in body structures, suggesting it is applicable to attribute them to Procercopidae. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the extinction of Procercopidae and the origin and early diversification of modern Cercopoidea approximately coincided with the rise and explosive radiation of angiosperms in the late Early Cretaceous and onwards.

J	Yadok, BG; Pech, R; Chapman, H				Yadok, Biplang G.; Pech, Roger; Chapman, Hazel			Perception of predation risk by African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys sp. nov) is higher in forest-edge microhabitats	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Predation risk; Giving up density; African giant pouched rat; Afrotropical forests; Foraging	GIVING-UP DENSITIES; PATCH-USE; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; HABITAT; MICE; LANDSCAPE; RESPONSES; RODENTS; FIELD; CUES	How rodents perceive predation risk may alter their seed foraging behaviour and therefore potentially influence the recruitment of tree species. In this study we used two methods to investigate the effect of predation risk on habitat use by the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys sp. nov) in Ngel Nyaki forest reserve, Nigeria. The first method was 'giving up density' (GUD), an index of perceived risk of predation at an artificial food patch, and the second was the 'spool-and-line' approach, whereby unravelling spools attached to rodent bodies are used to trace their tracks. For our GUD experiment, we chose four major sites in the forest; two representative of core habitat and two at the forest edge. Additionally, three characteristic microsites were used in the GUD experiment dense understory, open understory and near-burrows. We hypothesised that GUDs would be lower on every succeeding observation day as rats learn to use the food patches, higher GUDs would be observed in the forest edges and open microsites, and rats would show preference for the microhabitats with least exposure to potential predators. In support of our first hypothesis, we found that GUDs were highest on the first experimental nights of every session. We also found that GUDs in the forest edges were higher than GUDs in the forest core. Lower GUDs were observed close to the rat burrows and in dense understory microsites, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Tracking of rat movements using the spool-and-line method overall revealed an even use across microhabitats, with a weak preference for those with logs, dense understory or exposed ground. Overall, our results suggest that vegetation density on a microhabitat scale has little or no effect on the perception of predation risk by African giant pouched rats.

J	Kawai, T				Kawai, Toshio			Revision of an armored searobin genus Scalicus Jordan 1923 (Actinopterygii: Teleostei: Peristediidae) with a single new species	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Scalicus paucibarbatus sp. nov.; Indo-Pacific; Synonym; Nemaperistedion; Deep-sea fish	NEW-CALEDONIA; FISHES; SCORPAENIFORMES; PISCES	The Indo-Pacific peristediid genus Scalicus Jordan 1923 is taxonomically revised with six species including a single new species: Scalicus engyceros (Gunther 1872), Scalicus hians (Gilbert and Cramer 1897), Scalicus orientalis (Fowler 1938), Scalicus paucibarbatus sp. nov., Scalicus quadratorostratus (Fourmanoir and Rivaton 1979) and Scalicus serrulatus (Alcock 1898). The new species differs from its congeners in having a stick-like rostral projection with ball-like fleshy mass at the tip, rostral projection width 2.12-4.60 in rostral projection length; 4 lip and 3 chin barbels; 8-11 branches on filamentous barbel; filamentous barbel lacking membrane between its each branch, its length 13.1-20.4% of standard length; posteriormost chin barbel simple (rarely divided into two branches at the base); and presence of antrorse spines on posterior bony plates of upper lateral row. It is clear that Scalicus amiscus (Jordan and Starks 1904) and Scalicus investigatoris (Alcock 1898) are junior synonyms of S. hians, respectively, and Scalicus gilberti (Jordan 1921) is a junior synonym of S. engyceros. A key to the species of Scalicus is presented. In addition, lectotypes are designated for S. hians, S. quadratorostratus and S. serrulatus, respectively.

Morphological and molecular taxonomy (530 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) confirm P beebei n. sp. and P cooki n. sp. as distinct species; these species are formally described, and details are provided of their distribution, habitat and species associations. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses support the placement of P beebei n. sp. and P cooki n. sp within the genus Pronanna and show that these two new deep-sea species form a well-supported Glade with the abyssal West Pacific P cingulata. Pronanna beebei n. sp. and P cooki n. sp. represent the first records of Pronanna from hydrothermal vents in the Caribbean Sea and Southern Ocean, respectively, and extend the known geographic range of the genus. For the first time, intraspecific phenotypic variation in size and sculpture has been reported for Pronanna. At the East Scotia Ridge, shell-size frequency distributions and median shell size of P cooki n. sp. varied significantly between the E2 and E9 vent fields, as well as between diffuse flow and high-temperature venting habitats within each field. The variation in shell sculpture in relation to habitat was also observed in P cooki n. sp.

J	White, KN				White, Kristine N.			Simplification of a species complex: Two new species of Leucothoidae (Crustacea: Amphipoda) previously attributed to Leucothoe spinicarpa (Abildgaard, 1789) in Florida, USA	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						18S rDNA; COI mtDNA; commensalism; new species; taxonomy	DNA; PHYLOGENY	Leucothoe spinicarpa (Abildgaard, 1789) has long been thought of as a cosmopolitan species; however, relatively recent morphological studies have discovered a species complex previously attributed to L. spinicarpa. Despite this, several species remain hardly distinguishable from the general leucothoid form of L. spinicarpa. Morphological analyses reveal two distinct species in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, which is supported by molecular mitochondrial COI and nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA data. Leucothoe tunica sp. nov. and L. machidai sp. nov. are described herein. Analyses of DNA sequences from specimens from Tampa Bay, FL, Big Pine Key, FL, and Belize of L. tunica sp. nov. demonstrate intraspecific genetic structure in morphologically identical populations. Therefore, the geographically distant populations of L. tunica sp. nov. thus represent one species with a wide distribution, whereas L. machidai sp. nov. has so far been collected only in Tampa Bay.

This nematode species typically infects early instar host larvae and emerges after parasitic development to kill last-instar larvae. Parasitized adults, however, have occasionally been reported from field collections. We obtained low rates (1.7-11.5%) of parasitized adults in laboratory exposures only when Culex pipiens pipiens fourth-instar larvae nearing pupation were exposed to infective nematodes. This did not allow an adequate interval for parasitic development in immature host stages. Parasitized adult females in a multiple-choice assay were three times more likely to seek water than a blood source (63.1 vs. 20.5%), whereas uninfected females were twice as likely to seek blood than water (64%3.9 vs. 32.6%). This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing the only mechanism for dispersal and colonization of new host habitats while concurrently avoiding risks from the defensive behaviors associated with blood-feeding. Behavioral alternation in Cx. p. pipiens larval hosts was also examined using larvae infected as second instars to allow for a normal duration of parasitic development. As larvae neared pupation and parasite emergence, parasitized larvae became more spatially aggregated than unparasitized larvae. This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing a corresponding increase in post-parasite aggregation, which facilitates formation of large mating clusters and concomitantly reproductive success. Parasites derive fitness gains by overriding host autonomy, whereas hosts have zero fitness once parasitism is established, suggesting a coevolutionary response is inoperative and that the behavioral modifications may be adaptive.

J	Ferreira, VG; Higuti, J; Martens, K				Ferreira, Vitor Gois; Higuti, Janet; Martens, Koen			A striking case of convergent evolution in two species of Cypricercinae (Crustacea, Ostracoda), with the description of a new genus and species from Brazil	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Amazon River floodplain; Araguaia River floodplain; Parana River floodplain; Cypricercinae; Macrophytes	PARANA RIVER; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; STRANDESIA; KERALA	Neostrandesia striata gen. n. sp. n. is here described and constitutes an interesting case of convergent evolution with Bradleytriebella lineata (Victor and Fernando, 1981). Both cypricercine species look superficially similar, with comparable valve and carapace shapes and especially ornamentation, as in both species the valves are densely set with longitudinal ridges. However, examination of the limb chaetotaxy shows important differences, especially in the chaetotaxy of the maxillula-palp which shows reduced numbers of claws and setae, and in the first thoracopod, in which seta 'b' has taken a giant aspect in the new taxon. These, and other, differences merit the allocation of these two species to different genera and even tribes within the subfamily Cypricercinae. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Wesener, T				Wesener, Thomas			The oldest pill millipede fossil: A species of the Asiatic pill millipede genus Hyleoglomeris in Baltic amber (Diplopoda: Glomerida: Glomeridae)	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Eocene; Soil arthropods; Europe; Cave relicts; Micro-CT scan	CRETACEOUS BURMESE AMBER; VERHOEFF; MYRIAPODA	The first new fossil pill millipede, order Glomerida, description in more than 150 years is based on two specimens, one male and one female, found in Baltic amber. Both specimens were studied with light- and micro-CT technology, allowing a detailed reconstruction of the posterior telopods and numerous other morphological characters. Based on these characters, the specimens can be securely placed in the megadiverse, mainly Asiatic genus Hyleoglomeris Verhoeff, 1910 as a new species, Hyleoglomeris groehni n. sp. The species H. groehni n. sp. is the oldest and only known fossil member of the Glomerida that is sufficiently described to allow for placement in a family or genus. The discovery of a fossil Hyleoglomeris in Baltic amber has biogeographic implications as the genus is now speciose in Asia, with the nearest relatives found in the Caucasus and some caves in Serbia and Greece. With the discovery of a fossil European Hyleoglomeris species, the cave Hyleoglomeris species are interpreted as relicts, surviving underground as living witnesses of a different time when Hyleoglomeris was still extant in Europe. Other cave Glomerida in Europe, as well as morphologically aberrant pill millipede species endemic to the Canary Islands, should be checked for potential placement in Hyleoglomeris.

No other epigean or hypogean decapod shrimps were known from the area. A combined morphological and molecular data were used for its description from the only locality in central Eastern Serbia (Vrelo Krupaja). This new cave shrimp species with a short unarmed rostrum lacks eye or body pigmentation, and can be easily distinguished from any other atyid genus and species by a combination of unique morphological characters, among which (1) the concave posterior margin of the telson, (2) maxilliped I exopodite with no trace of a flagellum, (3) maxilliped III and (4) all pereopods without exopodites, are the most striking. The taxonomic status of the genus within the family Atyidae together with the unique taxonomical traits in Ficticaris are discussed. Among these traits, the telson that has been neglected until now, has shown some taxonomically important characters within Atyidae. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The morphology is conserved in many groups and taxonomic arrangements may be confusing within closely related species. Amphisbaena munoai and A. prunicolor slender bodied worm lizards associated with the Amphisbaena darwinii species group and distributed in southern South America (southern Brazil and Uruguay) were traditionally considered allopatric and distinguished from each other mainly by their coloration pattern and cephalic shields. However, the reassessment of morphological variation including specimens from new localities indicated the need for a taxonomic reappraisal. We used morphological, molecular and distributional data in an integrative approach to reassess taxonomic diversity and propose a phylogenetic hypothesis for the evolution of the group. Our results indicated a hidden diversity, allowing the description of three new species from Coastal and Grasslands formations in southern Brazil.

Due to the scarcity of studies, very little is known regarding the Middle East species, which are placed on the north-western edge of the genus' distribution. Numerous museum specimens from across the entire range of Caridina in the Middle East were thus analysed using morphological characters and mitochondria) sequences (16S) in order to gain insight into the biodiversity of the genus in the region. Consequently, the present study describes three new atyid species of the genus Caridina H. Milne Edwards, 1837, Caridina enbilului sp. nov., Caridina enkii sp. nov. and Caridina shahrazadae sp. nov. from freshwater habitats of Syria, Iraq and Iran respectively. Furthermore, Caridina fossarum Heller, 1862 is redescribed, while the taxonomic status of Caridina syriaca Bouvier, 1904 and Caridina babaulti basrensis Al-Adhub & Hamzah, 1987 is discussed and the latter synonymized with Caridina fernandoi Arudpragasam & Costa, 1962. C. shahrazadae sp. nov. differs from its congener C fossarum by the reduced branchial formula of the latter species, the absence of an appendix interna at the endopod of the male's first pleopod, and the lack of a prominent sexual dimorphism on the propodus of the third and fourth pereiopods. C. enbilului sp. nov. differs from C. fossarum in the same characters as C. shahrazadae sp. nov., while from the latter species C. enbilului sp. nov. is different in showing a distinct tooth on the pterygostomial margin of the carapace, by a well-developed arthrobranch on the first pereiopod, a well-developed podobranch on the second maxilliped and a more slender endopod of the male's first pleopod. C. enkii sp. nov. can be distinguished from C. fossarum by the more developed sexual appendages of male specimens as well as more slender pereiopods. In addition, the genetic analysis supports the existence of multiple species in the Middle East, while their phylogenetic relationships and their geographic distribution are described.

Among other invertebrates, land planarians have been sampled from caves in the Neotropical region, where their diversity seems to be high, but almost unknown. Besides being photophobic, land flatworms depend on the moisture of their microhabitats, since they do not have water-saving adaptations and, thus, caves seem to be an appropriate refuge for them. In the present study we describe two new species of Geoplaninae sampled from two types of cave lithologies: Pasipha carajaensis sp. nov. was sampled in ferruginous caves from the Amazonian biome and Pasipha tutameia sp. nov., in a limestone cave from the Cerrado biome. The new species differ from their congeners and from each other by the color pattern and characteristics of the copulatory apparatus. P. tutameia sp. nov. shows an inverted penis, a type of copulatory apparatus that is also known from another genus of Geoplaninae, among other triclads, but it is described for Pasipha for the first time. Considering that only a single specimen was collected in each cave and that both species are devoid of troglomorphic traits, we consider that their occurrence in caves might be occasional.

The most widespread taxon is the southern European genus Alpioniscus, which consists of two subgenera: Alpioniscus s.s. and Illyrionethes. Before this study, 14 nominal troglobiotic Illyrionethes taxa were recorded from the Dinaric Karst. Our molecular analyses using two mitochnodrial DNA (16S rRNA and COI) fragments and a nuclear gene (H3) fragment on all known Dinaric taxa identified three distinct lineages: strasseri-, heroldi- and magnus-lineage. Our results confirmed the validity of most nominal species. The exceptions are Alpioniscus balthasari, which consists of two different species including Alpioniscus iapodicus, and Alpioniscus heroldi, which is paraphyletic with respect to Alpioniscus bosniensis. The strasseri-lineage was highly supported by all phylogenetic methods used; therefore, we performed a detailed morphological analysis to distinguish and characterize the species of this group. New morphological characters, such as body part ratios, are proposed for future species identification. In addition, we redescribe three known species (Alpioniscus strasseri, Alpioniscus christiani and Alpioniscus balthasari) and describe two new ones (Alpioniscus hirci sp. nov. and Alpioniscus velebiticus sp. nov.). As a result, 15 nominal species of Illyrionethes are currently known from the Dinaric Karst.

Delimiting species based on multisource datasets provides a solution to overcome current systematic issues of closely related populations. Here, we use an integrative taxonomic approach based on new genetic and eco-chemical datasets to resolve the taxonomic status of Bombus lapponicus and Bombus sylvicola. Our results support the conspecific status of B. lapponicus and B. sylvicola and that the low gradual divergence around the Arctic Circle between Fennoscandia and Alaska does not imply speciation in this species complex. Therefore, based on our molecular and morphological analyses, we propose to assign them subspecific status: Bombus lapponicus lapponicus from Fennoscandia and West Siberia and Bombus lapponicus sylvicola comb. nov. from Alaska and Yukon. In addition, our analyses reveal a cryptic species in the B. lapponicus complex from Alaska, which we describe here as new: Bombus (Pyrobombus) interacti sp. nov.

J	Cernansky, A				Cernansky, Andrej			The first potential fossil record of a dibamid reptile (Squamata: Dibamidae): a new taxon from the early Oligocene of Central Mongolia	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Squamata; osteology; phylogeny; Palaeogene; Asia	CONVERGENT EVOLUTION; CRANIAL MORPHOLOGY; BURROWING REPTILES; FOSSORIAL LIZARDS; EOCENE; AMPHISBAENIANS; PALEOGENE; PHYLOGENY; MIOCENE; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Dibamid reptiles have a known current distribution on two continents (Asia and North America). Although this clade represents an early-diverging group in the Squamata and thus should have a long evolutionary history, no fossil record of these peculiar burrowing squamate reptiles has been documented so far. The fossil material described here comes from the early Oligocene of the Valley of Lakes in Central Mongolia. This material consists of jaws and is placed in the clade Dibamidae on the basis of its morphology, which is further confirmed by phylogenetic analyses. In spite of the fragmentary nature of this material, it thus forms the first, but putative, fossil evidence of this clade. If correctly interpreted, this material demonstrates the occurrence of Dibamidae in East Asia in the Palaeogene, indicating its distribution in higher latitudes than today. The preserved elements possess a unique combination of character states, and a new taxon name is therefore erected: Hoeckosaurus mongoliensis sp. nov. The dentary of Hoeckosaurus exhibits some characters of the two extant dibamid taxa. However, the open Meckel's groove, together with other characters, show that this group was morphologically much more diverse in the past.

SP; CYCLOPHYLLIDEA; SHREWS; GENUS; REDESCRIPTION; DITESTOLEPIDINI; MORPHOLOGY; GULYAEV; UTERUS	We analyse the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status of hymenolepidid cestodes with rudimentary rostellum, parasitic in Holarctic shrews of the genus Sorex. These cestodes were previously termed as a 'Ditestolepis clade' and encompass eight genera: Diorchilepis, Ditestolepis, Ecrinolepis, Gulyaevilepis, Mathevolepis, Novobrachylepis, Spalania and Spasskylepis. Representatives of seven of these were available for molecular study, including type species of all seven genera. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the 28S rRNA gene supports this group of genera as monophyletic. The 'Ditestolepis clade' consists of two subclades. One of these includes genera containing cestodes having suckers positioned inside bothrium-like depressions (Ditestolepis, Gulyaevilepis and Spasskylepis). The second subclade contains cestodes with suckers expanding far beyond the margins of the scolex (Mathevolepis, Ecrinolepis, Spalania and Novobrachylepis). The relative taxonomic value of several additional morphological characters is discussed. Genetic data convincingly demonstrate that Ditestolepis diaphana, Spasskylepis ovaluteri and Mathevolepis macyi represent complexes of morphologically similar species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we resurrect the genus Spalania. Amended generic diagnoses and keys to identification of the genera in the Ditestolepis clade, as well as keys to the known species, are provided.

The morphological and molecular data, including three species delimitation models, lend support to the hypothesis that the taxon C. floridanus sensu lato represents a species complex. Diagnostic morphological characteristics are highlighted and discussed within this group to assist in future morphological analyses.

Molecular systematics of the heteronemertean genus Dushia (Nemertea, Pilidiophora), with descriptions of D. wijnhoffae sp. nov. and D. nigra species complex comb. nov.	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Heteronemertea; Lineidae; marine invertebrates; MEGA; MrBayes; new species; phylogeny; RAxML; taxonomy; TCS	RIBBON WORM RELATIONSHIPS; PHYLOGENY; PROBOSCIS; TAXONOMY; TOOL	The heteronemertean genus Dushia Correa, 1963 was established for what was identified as D. atra (Girard. 1851) (originally Meckelia atra) based on material from littoral, shallow waters in Curacao, while the nominal species Meckelia atra was originally described from deep water off Florida Cape. In this paper, we conclude that the type species for Dushia has been misidentified. Based on specimens from the Caribbean, we establish D. wijnhoffae Schwartz & Norenburg sp. nov. to represent the true identity of the genus, according to Article 70.3.2 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; Meckelia atra should be regarded as a nomen dubium. While the genus has remained monotypic since its establishment, our molecular analysis discovered a second member-or rather a group of members-from the West Pacific. This 'group of members', herein termed Dushia nigra (Stimpson, 1855) species complex comb. nov., involves i) at least two genetically separated biological entities, 0.136-0.148 (p-distance) and 0.152-0.168 (K2P) apart in terms of 513-bp COI sequences, which we interpret as likely to represent cryptic species, three color forms, orange, brown, and black, with the last one occurring most frequently, and iii) four nominal species, Meckelia nigra Stimpson, 1855 (now Cerebratulus niger), Meckelia rubella Stimpson, 1855 (now Cerebratulus rubellus), Micrura formosana Yamaoka, 1939, and Micrura japonica Iwata, 1952. At present, however, we have no objective ground as to which of the four potentially available names (i.e., formosana, japonica, nigra, and rubella) should be allotted to the two cryptic species discovered in the analysis, because i) a single locality can harbor two cryptic species, ii) a single cryptic species may contain three different color morphs (i.e., orange, brown, black), and iii) no data from the type localities for these four nominal species are available at the moment. Our multi-locus analysis of heteronemerteans-for which 16S rRNA, COI. 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, histone H3 genes are available in public databases-shows that Dushia wijnhoffae sp. nov. and Dushia nigra species complex comb. nov form a Glade, which is closely related to Gorgonorhynchus albocinctus Kajihara, 2015 and an undetermined heteronemertean that has been misidentified as Cerebratulus leucopsis (Coe, 1901). Members of Dushia thus show a vicariant Caribbean-West-Pacific distribution, indicating that the lineage predates the rise of the Isthmus of Panama.

The subtribe Monoctonina has long been overlooked when it comes to morphological studies, probably due to the low economic importance of its members. Mainly distributed in high montane areas and forest ecosystems, species of Monoctonina are not often found in large populations and do not parasitize pests of cultivated plants. Our research uncovered five new species belonging to this subtribe (Monoctonus brachyradius sp. n., M. canadensis sp. n., M. inexpectatus sp. n., M. luteus sp. n., and M. parvipalpus sp. n.). We also redescribe species originally described over a century ago, and discuss the utility of certain morphological characters, as well as status of some species within Monoctonina.

SP MONOGENEA; ANCYROCEPHALIDAE; MULLET; PHYLOGENY; SPP.; SEA; PLATYHELMINTHES; VARIABILITY; PARASITE	Ligophorus satunensis n. sp. was collected from the bluetail mullet, Crenimugil buchanani (Bleeker, 1853), caught off Satun, Thailand, representing the first report of the Ligophorus species in Thailand. The new species is most similar to Ligophorus fenestrum Soo & Lim, 2012 in its fenestrated dorsal hamuli, a ventral bar with a long, bifurcated anteromedian protuberance (AMP) without lateral pieces, and a non-sclerotized vagina. However, it differs from the latter in its dorsal hamuli (up to two layers of fenestrations of the dorsal hamuli in L. satunensis n. sp. vs six layers in L. fenestrum), ventral hamuli (nonfenestrated vs fenestrated), penis (turning a full circle before reaching the genital pore vs turning less than half a circle), and its accessory piece (non-grooved basally and grooved distally vs simply grooved along its entire length). A single specimen, very similar to L. satunensis n. sp., obtained from the same host fish, which can be differentiated from the latter by a considerably shorter AMP of the ventral bar and a smaller and slender dorsal hamuli, is tentatively designated here as Ligophorus sp. Moreover, the phylogenetic trees constructed from the concatenated sequences of partial large-subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA (28S) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) regions support that L. satunensis n. sp. is a new species closely related to L. fenestrum.

Live specimens extracted from moss samples were used to establish laboratory cultures in order to obtain additional animals and eggs needed for their integrative descriptions. These descriptions are based on traditional morphological and morphometric data collected using both light and scanning electron microscopy, which, at the same time, were associated with DNA sequences of four genetic markers, three nuclear (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and ITS-2) and one mitochondrial (COI). The use of DNA sequences allowed for a more accurate verification of the taxonomic status of M noongaris sp. nov. and M. kamilae sp. nov as independent species of the hufelandi group. Although they both exhibit typical inverted goblet-shaped processes, they represent a recently discovered Glade, which was thought to group species with modified morphology of egg processes. Thus, this contribution expands the definition of the mentioned Glade and constitutes another link that will be helpful for future studies on the evolution of the M. hufelandi complex.

Leucoraja elaineae sp. nov., a new rough skate (Rajiformes: Rajidae) from the Western Indian Ocean	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Chondrichthyes; batoids; hardnose skate; Kenya; South Africa	CHONDRICHTHYES; BIODIVERSITY	A new species of the genus Leucoraja is described from off Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). The new species was collected during a survey of the RIV Fridtiof Nansen. Leucoraja elaineae sp. n. is the third species in the genus found to occur in the WIO, and the only species in the genus Leucoraja known exclusively from this region. Its closest geographic congener L. wallacei, occurring from Namibia to southern Mozambique, can be separated by a combination of morphological and meristic characters including an elongated, pronounced snout (L. elaineae sp. n.) vs a short, blunt snout (L. wallacei), higher predorsal vertebral (107 vs 64-74) and pectoral fin radial counts (77 vs 61-64), a dorsal surface pattern consisting of a single ocelli at the midbase of each pectoral fin, paired small white spots, and no banding or crossbars on its tail vs numerous rosettes and whorls, no prominent ocelli at the pectoral fin bases, and 3-4 tail bands. The only other WIO Leucoraja species in the genus, L. compagnoi is known only from South Africa and has a short, blunt snout, a lower upper tooth count (38 vs 57 in L. elaineae sp. n.), a plain dorsal disc color with no markings and distinct bands on its tail. All other members of the genus occur in the North Atlantic, except one species that occurs in the eastern Central Atlantic and one in the eastern Indian Ocean.

Myzostoma khanhkhoaensis (Myzostomida), a new myzostomid species from the Nhatrang Bay, Vietnam	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Annelida; taxonomy; symbiosis; commensal; cleptoparasite; South China Sea	PHYLOGENY; CRINOIDS; SYMBIONTS; ALIGNMENT; PACIFIC; 18S	A new myzostome species, described here as Myzostoma khanhkhoaensis sp. nov., was collected in Nhatrang Bay, central Vietnam, during investigation of symbionts associated with crinoids. Myzostoma khanhkhoaensis sp. nov. was found only on Clarkcomanthus albinotus Rowe, Hoggett, Birtles & Vail, 1986 in dense groups of up to 25 specimens. This species closely matches the colour pattern of the host by adjusting its cryptic colour and infects the distal part of crinoid arms, causing them to become curved. This is the first record of myzostomes that induce deformation of skeletal elements without the formation of galls or cysts. Morphologically M. khanhkhoaensis sp. nov. is close to M. cuniculus and M. pseudocuniculus but clearly differs from both of them by the shape of caudal blade and chaetae. Molecular-genetics analysis based on COI, 16S and 18S DNA placed Al. khanhkhoaensis sp. nov. in a Glade including M cuniculus, M. pseudocuniculus and M. indocuniculus.

(Conoidea: Bouchetispiridae), a new deep-sea gastropod from temperate Australia	MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Neogastropoda; COI; molecular systematics; radula; shell morphology; convergence	PHYLOGENY	This study presents the first record of the previously monotypic family Bouchetispiridae (Neogastropoda: Conoidea) outside of New Caledonia and provides the taxonomic description of Bouchetispira ponderi n. sp. from deep waters off the coast of New South Wales, Australia. Molecular analysis based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA) mitochondrial markers confirms its placement within the family, which is corroborated based on similarities of the shell and hypodermic radula to its sister taxon Bouchetispira vitrea. B. ponderi differs from the latter in having shouldered, distinctly less convex whorls and a thicker, more opaque shell, as well as in details of the radula. Furthermore, the molecular results presented herein support its recognition as a new species. B. ponderi bears notable similarities in several shell characters to Belomitra pacifica (Belomitridae), providing another example of convergence with regard to shell morphology in the Neogastropoda.

To date, only 13 tardigrade taxa have been reported from this region (including one Milnesium species). We examined 46 specimens belonging to two new-to-science species of the genus Milnesium described herein using an integrative approach, including classical morphology and molecular marker (COI, ITS-2 and 28S rRNA) analysis. The species were found in two moss and lichen samples collected in the Ivohibory forest in Fianarantsoa Province. Milnesium matheusi sp. nov., with claw configuration [3-3]-[3-3] and rather wide buccal tube, morphologically is most similar to: Mil. beatae Roszkowska, Ostrowska & Kaczmarek, 2015, Mil bohleberi Bartels, Nelson, Kaczmarek & Michalczyk, 2014, Mil. eurystomum Maucci, 1991, Mil. shilohae Meyer, 2015 and Mil. tumanovi Pilato, Sabella & Lisi, 2016; however, it differs from these by morphometric characteristics. Milnesium wrightae sp. nov., by the presence of four points on secondary branches of claws IV, is most similar to Mil. quadrifidum Nederstrom, 1919. However, Mil. wrightae sp. nov. differs from Mil. quadrifidum by claw configuration ([4-4]-[4-4] in Mil. quadrifidum vs. [3-3]-[4-4] in Mil. wrightae sp. nov.), but also by the position of the fourth points on secondary branches of claws IV, which are located near the base of the claw in the new species and near the top of the claw in Mil. quadrifidum. Genotypic analysis showed that Mil. matheusi sp. nov. is most similar to Milnesium sp. (28S rRNA), Mil. variefidum (COI) and Mil. t. tardigradum (ITS-2) while Mil. wrightae sp. nov. is most similar to Milnesium sp. (28S rRNA), Mil. variefidum (COI) and Mil. matheusi (ITS-2). Five Milnesium taxa are recorded from the African region, including the two new species from Madagascar reported in this study.

All have four pairs of spermathecal pores in 5/6-8/9, which indicates that they should belong to the corticis-group. Their morphological characteristics are compared to other similar species in the corticis-group from China and other Asian countries, such as Amynthas pulvinus Sun & Jiang, 2013, Amynthas homosetus (Chen, 1938), Amynthas corticis (Kinberg, 1867), Amynthas dorsualis Sun & Qiu, 2013, and Amynthas earnosus (Goto & Hatai, 1899). In addition, the results presented are confirmed by the pairwise comparison of COI barcode sequences. The pairwise distances between each new species and the other eighteen corticis-group species are greater than 14.7% on average. Furthermore, the paitwise distance between A. shengtangmontis shengtangniontis and A. shengtangmontis minusculus is 10.7-11.4%.

Revision of the New World genus Enderleiniella Becker, 1912 (Diptera, Chloropidae)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Grass fly; frit fly; Neotropic; Nearctic; Central America; taxonomy		The genus Enderleiniella Becker, 1912 is revised. The genus is distinguished on the basis of a somewhat flattened head with the inner vertical setae located anteromedially to the outer vertical setae, three lightly incised lines on the scutum, trapezoidal or rectangular scutellum with marginal setae borne on tubercles, reduced alula and anal angle of the wing, and the structure of the male genitalia. The genus contains eleven species in the northern Neotropical and southern Nearctic Regions: E. caerulea sp. nov. (type locality: Blue Creek, Belize); E. cryptica sp. nov. (type locality: 24 km W Piedras Blancas, Costa Rica); E. flavida sp. nov.

Caecilia pulchraserrana sp. nov. is similar to C. degenerata and C. corpulenta but differs from these species in having fewer primary annular grooves and a shorter body length. With this new species, the currently recognized species in the genus are increased to 35. Mitochondrial DNA sequences, including newly sequenced terminals representing two additional, previously unanalyzed species, corroborate the phylogenetic position of the new species within Caecilia and the monophyly of the genus. This analysis also included newly sequenced terminals of Epicrionops aff. parkeri (Rhinatrematidac) and trans-Andean Microcaecilia nicefori (Siphonopidae). Evidence was found for the non-monophyly of the family Siphonopidae and the siphonopid genera Microcaecilia and Siphonops. The implications of these results for caecilian systematics are discussed and the status of the transAndean populations of Caecilia degenerata is commented upon.

A new cecidogenous species of many-plumed moth (Alucitidae) associated with Cordiera A. Rich. ex DC. (Rubiaceae) in the Brazilian Cerrado	ZOOLOGIA			English	Article						Alucitid moths; Brazilian Savanna; insect galls; Prymnotomis; taxonomy	LEPIDOPTERA	Larvae of many-plumed moths (Alucitidae), especially in the world-wide genus Alucita Linnaeus, 1758 are known as borers or gall-inducers on flowers, fruits and shoots of a few dicotyledonous families, including Bignoniaceae, Caprifoliaceae and Rubiaceae. However, there is no study available on the biology of the monotypic, Neotropical genus Prymnotomis Meyrick, 1931 except for its original description that was based on a single male, the holotype of Prymnotomis crypsicroca Meyrick, 1931 from Espirito Santo, Brazil. We describe here a second species for this genus, Prymnotomis cecidicola sp. nov. whose larvae induce galls on Cordiera elliptica (Cham.) Kuntze (Rubiaceae), a dioecious plant with dimorphic inflorescences found in the Brazilian Cerrado, Planaltina City, Federal District. Adults, larvae, pupae and galls are illustrated under light and scanning electron microscopy. Galls are green, spherical, unilocular and develop individually on C. elliptica flower buds. During development they look like fruits in shape and colour but are larger, do not have style scars when on female plants, and are induced also in male inflorescences. Pupation occurs outside the gall within a silk cocoon, presumably in the litter. A preliminary analysis of DNA barcode sequences including putative members of other alucitid lineages and Neotropical BINs (Barcode Index Number) supports Prymnotomis cecidicola sp. nov. as an independent phylogenetic unit, with 12 to 18% divergence. Its nearest-neighbour was the BIN cluster 5 (BOLD:AAA0842) that includes specimens from Costa Rica.	[Moreira, Gilson R.

Pomponema veronicae sp. n. differs from other species of Pomponema by having buccal cavity with large pointed dorsal tooth, two subventral teeth and pairs of denticles, gubernaculum with two L-shaped lateral plates and having a membrane at its distal end that connects to L-shaped plate, and presence of a ventral orifice at distal end of L-shaped plates. It also differs from other species in the size of spicules and gubernaculum. The new species is considered most closely related to Parapomponema species because of the L-shaped lateral plates of gubernaculum, but the taxonomic status of Parapomponema was reviewed and Parapomponema and Propomponema are now synonymized with Pomponema. Pomponema cyatholaimoides is considered as a species inquirendum and Pomponema carinatum is accepted as Pomponema loticum. An updated identification key to species of Pomponema is included.

This is the fourth paper in a series to provide regional taxonomic data with previous papers reporting on Cnidaria, Echinodermata and Mollusca. Taxonomic data are presented for 23 species from 85 records within four polychaete families: Capitellidae, Opheliidae, Scalibregmatidae and Travisiidae, identified by a combination of morphological and genetic data, including molecular phylogenetic analyses. Two taxa (genetically separated from one another) morphologically matched the same known cosmopolitan species, Ophelina abranchiata that has a type locality in a different ocean basin and depth from where no genetic data was available. These two species were assigned the open nomenclature 'cf.' as a precautionary approach in taxon assignments to avoid overestimating species ranges. Twelve (12) taxa are here described as new species, Ammotrypanella keenani sp. nov., Ammotrypanella kersteni sp. nov., Ophelina curli sp. nov., Ophelina ganae sp. nov., Ophelina juhazi sp. nov., Ophelina martinezarbizui sp. nov., Ophelina meyerae sp. nov., Ophelina nunnallyi sp. nov., Oligobregma brasierae sp. nov., Oligobregma tani sp. nov., Oligobregma whaleyi sp. nov. and Travisia zieglerae sp. nov. For the remaining nine taxa, we have determined them to be potentially new species, for which we make the raw data, imagery and vouchers available for future taxonomic study. The CCZ is a region undergoing intense exploration for potential deep-sea mineral extraction from polymetallic nodules. We present these data to facilitate future taxonomic and environmental impact study by making both data and voucher materials available through curated and accessible biological collections.

The new species belongs to the Leptorhaphis species group and can be distinguished from other members of this group by features of the skeleton and colouration. The new species is sympatric with P. occidentalis, a hybridogenetic all-female biotype P. monacha-occidentalis, and hybrids between P. monacha-occidentalis females and P. jackschultzi males. The distribution of P. jackschultzi is highly restricted, and the main habitat, spring-fed marshy streams and pools, is susceptible to loss and degradation in a desert environment with increasing human water demand.

J	Fragoso, C; Rojas, P				Fragoso, Carlos; Rojas, Patricia			More new Diplotrema earthworm species from southern Mexico (Annelida, Crassiclitellata, Acanthodrilidae, Acanthodrilinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Acanthodrilinae; Mexico; Oaxaca; Chiapas; Tabasco; singletons	OLIGOCHAETA	Three new Acanthodrilinae species from the states of Oaxaca, Tabasco and Chiapas in southern Mexico are described, Diplotrema oaxacana sp. nov., Diplotrema tabascensis sp. nov., and Diplotrema kaxyebensis sp. nov., respectively. D. oaxacana sp. nov. is characterized by the presence of genital setae in segments 8 and 9, a spermathecal ampulla transversally connected to the duct and paired seminal vesicles in 11 and 12. D. tabascensis sp. nov. is separated from all Diplotrema species by genital setae in segment 16. The singleton D. kaxyebensis sp. nov. is characterized by a single pair of seminal vesicles in 12, genital setae in 8 and by a particular arrangement of spermathecal duct-ampulla-diverticulum connections. It is discussed that the neotropical Diplotrema species lineage does probably not belong to the southern hemisphere Diplotrema lineage, which indeed contains the majority of species; its taxonomic separation, however, should wait until more information is obtained on the molecular relationships among neotropical Acanthodrilinae. Finally the topic of describing new earthworm species on singletons is discussed; a decision table is provided to help earthworm taxonomists to decide about this aspect. This paper is dedicated to Dr. Pietro Omodeo for his important contribution to the fields of taxonomy and biogeography of earthworms, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.

Morphological, ecological, and molecular data clearly support the new species as distinct and place it within the 'australis group'. Gehyra electrum sp. nov. is distinguished from congeners by a combination of medium adult size (SVL 46-50 mm), an orange-brown to pinkish-orange background colouration with a pattern of distinct whitish spots and irregular black to purple-brown blotches or bars, possessing 7-8 undivided subdigital lamellae on the expanded portion of the fourth toe, and a wedge-shaped mental scale that separates the inner-postmental scales along 40% or more of their length. Gehyra electrum sp. nov. is a rock specialist currently known only from granite outcrops of the Mt Surprise region, Queensland. This is the second recently described Gehyra from the Einasleigh Uplands and adds to the growing number of endemic reptiles recognised in the region.

PICKARD-CAMBRIDGE; TAXONOMIC REVISION; HEMIRRHAGUS SIMON; TRAPDOOR SPIDERS; DNA BARCODES; IQ-TREE; GENUS; APHONOPELMA; MOJAVE	The tarantula spider genus Aphonopelma Pocock, 1901 has received considerable attention in recent years but the group's diversity remains poorly understood in Mexico, particularly in the pine-oak woodlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental and associated Madrean "Sky Islands". A pair of tarantulas discovered from an unsampled region in the Sierra de Bacadehuachi (the westernmost range of the Sierra Madre Occidental) in northeastern Sonora was found to be closely related to four species from the Madrean "Sky Islands" in Arizona and New Mexico. An integrative approach for delimiting species (incorporating data from molecular phylogenetics, morphology, distributions, and breeding periods) suggests that the specimens from Sierra de Bacadehuachi belong to an undescribed species that is herein named Aphonopelma bacadehuachi sp. nov. This new species adds to our knowledge of an increasingly diverse assemblage of Aphonopelma from the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands Hotspot. Collaborations between Mexican and American researchers are needed to accelerate discovery and description of the group's remaining diversity, particularly in light of the many threats facing the ecoregion including habitat degradation and climate change.

In this paper, we describe three new species from algal turf along a rocky shove on the south coast of South Africa. All three species are characterised by having pseudo-simple chactae by loss of blade and enlargement of shafts together with compound heterogomph bidentate falcigers. Syllis zahri sp. nov.

This new species resembles its congeners and some species in the genus Yarepotamon Dai & Turkay, 1997, but can be distinguished from these by its combination of the carapace, third maxilliped, male gonopod, female vulvae characters and size. Molecular data derived from the mitochondrial 16S rDNA supports the establishment of the new species, but does not provide further evidence as to its generic placement.

Poecillastra tavianii n. sp. differs from the other congeneric species mainly for the dicho- and mesodichotriaenes, never observed in the genus, and the abundance and variety of spirasters. Hymedesmia (Hymedesmia) quadridentata n. sp. is characterized by the presence of two types of chelae. In particular, the unguiferate chelae (round shaft and four teeth at both extremities) represent a peculiar character of the species. Our contribution increases the number of sponge fauna associated to the best known Central Mediterranean CWC habitats to 98 improving the still scant knowledge on the biodiversity of the Mediterranean CWC habitats.

The examination of morphological characters revealed that this new species is similar to P. siamensis (Oka, 1917), a common turtle leech species found in Thailand. Placobdelloides sirikanchanae sp. nov. demonstrates distinct morphological characters, with an elongated, narrow body, 13-17 well-developed knob papillae on each annulus, dark brown to greenish dorsal color with a crimson median line, the absence of a scarlet dot, different male and female gonopore distributions, a rough posterior sucker with a random pit distribution, and 104-115 eggs per clutch. The phylogenetic relationships of COI-ND1 genes were clarified and shown to be distinct from those of P. siamensis. Additionally, habitat preferences tended toward low oxygen conditions such as puddles or water patches on rubber plantations.

A total of 38 species is reported, including new records of Passalus inca Zang, 1905 and P. lunaris (Kaup, 1871), and three new brachypterous species: Passalus bolivianus sp. nov., P. canoi sp. nov., and P. gonzalezae sp. nov. Most of the species (27) belongs to the Passalini tribe, especially to the genus Passalus Fabricius, 1792 (19 species); the Proculini tribe is represented by eleven species in three genera. The number of species of Bolivia is low and reflects the lack of a systematic exploration of this country; more surveys are needed, especially in ecosystems such as montane forest and tropical rain forest.

The Pseudoplagioporinae, a new subfamily in the Opecoelidae Ozaki, 1925 (Trematoda) for a small clade parasitizing mainly lethrinid fishes, with three new species	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						biodiversity; Great Barrier Reef; host specificity; Moreton Bay; phylogenetic	DIGENEA OPECOELIDAE; PLAGIOPORUS STAFFORD; N. SP; HOST-SPECIFICITY; SHALLOW-WATER; MARINE FISHES; LIFE-CYCLE; SP-NOV; GENUS; PLATYHELMINTHES	The Pseudoplagioporinae n. subf. (Opecoelidae) is proposed for species of Pseudoplagioporus Yamaguti, 1938, Fairfaxia Cribb, 1989, and Shimazuia Cribb, 2005, a small group of relatively distinctive, Indo-West Pacific taxa reliably known almost entirely from emperor fishes (Perciformes: Lethrinidae). These taxa were previously recognized in the Plagioporinae Manter, 1947, but that subfamily has recently been restricted to a clade of Holarctic, freshwater taxa, whereas analyses of new genetic data find the pseudoplagioporines to form a distinct clade among a larger assemblage of marine taxa. New material was sourced from fishes collected mainly in Queensland waters, Australia, but with some specimens from off Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Japan. Orthodena tropica Durio & Manter, 1968 is transferred to Pseudoplagioporus as P. tropicus (Durio & Manter, 1968) n. comb., and Orthodena Durio & Manter, 1968 thus becomes a synonym of that genus. Three new species of Pseudoplagioporus are proposed. One, P. mediocris n. sp., like other species of Pseudoplagioporus, occurs in several species of Lethrinus. The other two new species, P. labiatus n. sp. and P. roseovulatus n. sp., apparently do not infect species of Lethrinus and were instead found only in the Bigeye emperor Monotaxis grandoculis (Forsskal) and the Redfin emperor M. heterodon (Bleeker), respectively. New host-locality combinations and the first genetic data, for the ribosomal ITS2 DNA region, and the 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and cox1 mtDNA genes, are reported for Pseudoplagioporus lethrini Yamaguti, 1938, P. interruptus Durio & Manter, 1968, P. tropicus, Fairfaxia lethrini Cribb, 1989, Fairfaxia cribbi Hassanine & Gibson, 2005, and Shimazuia lethrini (Yamaguti, 1938) Cribb, 2005.

J	Cole, ML				Cole, Mary L.			Revision of Chondrocyclus s.l. (Mollusca: Cyclophoridae), with description of a new genus and twelve new species	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Cyclophoroidea; new genus; systematics; South African distribution; forests	LAND SNAILS CAENOGASTROPODA; CANNIBAL SNAILS; SOUTHERN AFRICA; GASTROPODA-PROSOBRANCHIA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; EASTERN CAPE; FOREST; PERIPATOPSIS; ONYCHOPHORA; DIPLOMMATINIDAE	Chondrocyclus Ancey, 1898 is a genus of nine species of African operculate land snails restricted to indigenous forest and mesic thicket. Worn specimens (i.e., without a periostracum or operculum), on which some species descriptions and records were based, appear to be indistinguishable morphologically. A comprehensive revision of Chondrocyclus s.l. is provided here based on comparative morphological examinations of the shell, protoconch, periostracum, operculum, radula and penis, and on mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA. Two genus-level lineages are recognised, Chondrocyclus s.s. and Afrocyclus gen. nov. Revised species descriptions are given for seven species. Two species, C. meredithae Bruggen, 1983 and C. chirindae Bruggen, 1986 both from north of South Africa, are removed from Chondrocyclus. Twelve new species are described: C. herberti sp. nov., C. silvicolus sp. nov., C. amathole sp. nov., C. pondoensis sp. nov., C. devilliersi sp. nov., C. pulcherrimus sp. nov., C. cooperae sp. nov., C. langebergensis sp. nov., C. kevincolei sp. nov., A. oxygala gen. et sp. nov., A. potteri gen. et sp. nov. and A. bhaca gen. et sp. nov. This is the first detailed systematic revision of an Afrotropical cyclophorid group to include morphological and molecular data. This study complements research on other taxa of low-vagility forest-dwelling habitat specialists by providing comparative distribution data for an independent, widespread group. Such evidence is urgently needed for conservation of South Africa's threatened forest biome.

Asia and the Australopacific region: a revisionary checklist (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) including description of three new genera and 13 new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Fireflies; Luciolinae; taxonomy; new species; new genera; new combinations	PYGOLUCIOLA-WITTMER COLEOPTERA; MALAYSIA COLEOPTERA; GENUS; FIREFLIES; OLIVIER; LARVAE; REDESCRIPTION; BALLANTYNE; INFERENCE; BEHAVIOR	This overview of the Luciolinae addresses the fauna of S. E. Asia including India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Australopacific area of Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji. Of the 28 genera now recognised in the Luciolinae we address 27 genera from the study area as defined above, including three new genera which are described herein, and 222 species including 13 species newly described herein. Photuroluciola Pic from Madagascar is the only Luciolinae genus not addressed here. A key to genera is presented. Keys to species are either included here or referenced in existing literature. Twelve genera have had no new taxonomic decisions made nor are any new species records listed, and are addressed in an abbreviated fashion, with short diagnoses and plates of features of life stages: Aquatica Fu et al. 2010, Australoluciola Ballantyne 2013, Convexa Ballantyne 2009, Emeia Fu et al. 2012a, Inflata Boontop 2015, Lloydiella Ballantyne 2009, Missimia Ballantyne 2009, Pteroptyx Olivier 1902, Pyrophanes Olivier 1885, Sclerotia Ballantyne 2016, Triangulara Pimpasalee 2016, and Trisinuata Ballantyne 2013. Abscondita Ballantyne 2013 contains 8 species, and includes new records for Abs. anceyi (Olivier 1883), Abs. chinensis (L.) (which is newly synonymised with Luciola succincta Bourgeois), Abs. terminalis (Olivier 1883) including a first record from both Laos and Thailand, and Abs. perplexa (Walker 1858). Luciola pallescens Gorham 1880 is transferred to Abscondita and the pronotal colour range is addressed from a wide range of localities. Abs. berembun Nada sp. nov. and Abs. jerangau Nada sp. nov. are described from Malaysia. Hooked bursa plates are described for pallescens and berembun. Aquilonia Ballantyne 2009 is expanded to include 3 species. Gilvainsula Ballantyne 2009, represented by two species from the south eastern coast of New Guinea is synonymised under Aquilonia Ballantyne 2009, which is briefly redescribed and keyed from: Aquil. costata (Lea) from northern Australia, including many new records, Aquil. messoria (Ballantyne) comb. nov. and Aquil. similismessoria (Ballantyne) comb. nov. Asymmetricata Ballantyne 2009 now includes 4 species. As. bicoloripes (Pic 1927) comb. nov. and As. humeralis (Walker 1858) comb. nov. are transferred from Luciola, with L. doriae Olivier 1885, L. impressa Olivier 1910b and L. notatipennis Olivier 1909a newly synonymised with As. humeralis. Luciola aemula Olivier 1891 is synonymised with As. ovalis (Hope 1831). The variation in the extent of the anterior median emargination of the light organ in ventrite 7, and the possibility of a bipartite light organ in males of As. circumdata (Motsch. 1854) is explored. Females of both As. circumdata and As. ovalis (Hope 1831) are without bursa plates and the distinctively shaped median oviduct plate in each is described. Records from Thailand are recorded for both As. circumdata and As. ovalis. Atyphella Olliff 1890 now contains 28 species with 4 transferred from other genera, and one new species: Aty. abdominalis (Olivier 1886) comb. nov. and Aty. striata (Fabricius 1801) comb. nov. are transferred from Luciola, with Aty. carolinae Olivier 1911b and Aty. rennellia (Ballantyne 2009) comb. nov. transferred from Magnalata Ballantyne 2009. Atyphella telokdalam Ballantyne sp. nov. from Indonesia is described herein. Atyphella is now known from records in the Philippines and Indonesia as well as Australia and New Guinea. Colophotia Motschulsky 1853 is considered here from seven species for which intact types can be located for three. An abbreviated revision based on the United States National Museum collection only is presented, with specimens of C. bakeri Pic 1924, C. brevis Olivier 1903a, C. plagiata (Erichson 1834) and C. praeusta (Eschscholtz 1822) redescribed, using where possible features of males, females and larvae. Colophotia particulariventris Pic 1938 is newly synonymised with C. praeusta. Colophotia miranda Olivier 1886 and L. truncata Olivier 1886 are treated as species incertae sedis. Curtos Motschulsky 1845 includes 19 species with suggestions made, but not yet formalised, for the possible transfer of the following seven species from Luciola: Luciola complanata Gorham 1895, L. costata Pic 1929, L. delauneyi Bourgeois 1890, L. deplanata Pic 1929, L. extricans Walker 1858, L. multicostulata Pic 1927 and L. nigripes Gorham 1903. Curtos is not revised here. Emarginata Ballantyne gen nov. is described for E. trilucida (Jeng et al. 2003b) comb. nov., transferred from Luciola and characterised by the emarginated elytral apex. An extended range of specimens from Thailand is listed. Kuantana Ballantyne gen. nov. from Selangor, Malaysia is described from K. menayah gen. et sp. nov. having bipartite light organs in ventrite 7 and an asymmetrical tergite 8 which is not emarginated on its left side. Female has no bursa plates. Luciola Laporte 1833 s. stricto as defined by a population of the type species Luciola italica (L. 1767) from Pisa, Italy, is further expanded and considered to comprise the following19 species: L. antipodum (Bourgeois 1884), L. aquilaclara Ballantyne 2013, L. chapaensis Pic 1923 which is synonymised with L. atripes Pic 1929, L. curtithorax Pic 1928, L. filiformis Olivier 1913c, L. horni Bourgeois 1905, L. hypocrita Olivier 1888, L. italica (L. 1767), L. kagiana Matsumura 1928, L. oculofissa Ballantyne 2013, L. pallidipes Pic 1928 which is synonymised with L. fletcheri Pic 1935, L. parvula Kiesenwetter 1874, L. satoi Jeng & Yang 2003, L. tuberculata Yiu 2017, and two species treated as near L. laticollis Gorham 1883, and near L. nicollieri Bugnion 1922. The following are described as new: L. niah Jusoh sp. nov., L. jengai Nada sp. nov. and L. tiomana Ballantyne sp. nov. Luciola niah sp. nov. female has two wide bursa plates on each side of the bursa. Luciola s. lato (as defined here) consists of 36 species. Twenty-seven species formerly standing under Luciola have been assigned to other genera or synonymised. Seven species are recommended for transfer to Curtos, and 32 species now stand under species incertae sedis. Magnalata Ballantyne is reduced to the type species M. limbata and redescribed. Medeopteryx Ballantyne 2013 is expanded to 20 species with the addition of two new combinations, Med. semimarginata (Olivier 1883) comb. nov. and Med. timida (Olivier 1883) comb. nov., both transferred from Luciola, and one new species, Med. fraseri Nada sp. nov. from Malaysia.

While phylogenetic analyses indicate their distinctiveness, no further taxonomic action is taken with Luciola cruciata Motschulsky 1854 and L. owadai Sato et Kimura 1994 from Japan given the importance of the former as a national icon. Analyses also indicate that Lampyroidea syriaca Costa 1875 belongs in Luciola s. str. A much wider taxonomic analysis of this genus including all the species is necessary before any further action can be taken.	[Ballantyne, L.

Description of Onthophagus humboldti and Uroxys bonplandi, two new scarab beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae) from Costa Rica, with notes on tropical mountain brachyptery and endemicity	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Biogeography; boreotropical distribution; Cordillera de Talamanca; extreme brachyptery; refugia; Last Glacial Maximum; mitochondrial DNA; paleogeography	SPECIES GROUPS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; GENUS; FLIGHTLESSNESS; EVOLUTION; DEFINITION; PHYLOGENY; ORIGINS; REFUGIA; TRENDS	Two new endemic species of scarab beetles are described from Costa Rica, Onthophagus humboldti sp. nov. and Uroxys bonplandi sp. nov. Onthophagus humboldti sp. nov. is also the tenth brachypterous Onthophagus species to be described worldwide, representing also a case of extreme brachyptery in Onthophagini. Illustrations for both new species, as well as marking differences with closely related species are included. Maps showing the distribution of the new species, as well as the distribution of brachypterous and endemic scarab-beetle species for Costa Rica are presented and discussed. The Cordillera de Talamanca represents an area where Scarabaeinae (four genera) show very high known levels of brachypterism in Mesoamerica. A reconstruction of the montane environment in the Cordillera de Talamanca during the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 24 ka) is analyzed, in order to try to understand a possible historical biogeography model that might promote high levels of brachypterism in scarab-beetles. The present study supports previous proposals that brachyptery is correlated with stable environments associated with deeply incised valleys. Tropical mountain ranges are also identified as having more endemics than lowland rain forests, contradicting accepted wisdom. Lastly, a mitochondrial DNA analysis supports the existence of the Onthophagus dicranius and the O. clypeatus species-groups as two well-defined and closely related branches.

Chrysogorgia ramificans sp. nov. belongs to the Chrysogorgia "group A, Spiculosae" with rods distributed in body wall and tentacles, and C. binata sp. nov. belongs to the "group C, Squamosae typicae" with rods and/or spindles not present but only scales. Chrysogorgia ramificans sp. nov. differs from congeners by its main stem with 2/5R branching sequence at the bottom forming two large bottlebrush-shaped branches with 1/3R branching sequence at the top. Chrysogorgia binata sp. nov. is similar to C. scintillans Bayer & Stefani, 1988, but differs by its larger polyps, larger sclerites in the body wall, and different scales in the upper part of polyps. The mtMutS genetic distances between C. ramificans sp. nov. and C. binata sp. nov. and congeners are in the range of 0.33%-2.28% and 0.33%-2.94%, respectively, while the intraspecific distances are in the range of 0-0.16%. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that C. ramificans sp. nov. is clustered with C. monticola Cairns, 2007 and C. binata sp. nov. is clustered with C. chryseis Bayer & Stefani, 1988, both with high support indicating close relationships.

The genus is endemic to Cameroon and previously included two species: L. edeaensis (Bott, 1969) (type species) from Lake Ossa wetland complex (altitudes below 400 m asl) and L. balssi (Bott, 1959) from Kumba and Mt. Manengouba (altitudes above 1300 m asl). Here two new species of Louisea are described based on morphological and/or genetic data: L. nkongsamba sp. nov. from the Nlonako Ecological Reserve (1000-1400 m asl) in the sub-montane zone and L. yabassi sp. nov. from Yabassi in the lowlands. A redescription and amended diagnostic features of L. edeaensis and L. balssi are provided, and the genus diagnosis is updated to accommodate all four species. An identification key is also provided for the species of Louisea. A tree of phylogenetic relationships based on three mtDNA loci (COI, 12S rRNA, and 16S rRNA) supports the taxonomic revision, and indicates speciation of Louisea species along an altitudinal gradient, but further phylogenetic analyses are needed to understand whether this can lend support to the hypothesis that there is a montane centre of speciation along the Cameroon Volcanic Line. The phylogenetic tree also shows that Buea Cumberlidge, Mvogo Ndongo, Clark & Daniels, 2019 and Potamonemus Cumberlidge & Clark, 1992 are sister genera that may be derived from the Louisea lineage.

Although both species resemble T. vitrirostris (Gilchrist and Thompson 1908), which is redescribed from both type and non-type specimens, in having a long upper jaw (posterior tip reaching to pectoral-fin insertion) and similar numbers of gill rakers and ventral scutes, the two new species differ in having fewer transverse scales (9-10 in both vs. 11-12 in T. vitrirostris). Thrissina cultella differs from T. serena in having a slender body [24.4-26.9% of standard length (SL) vs. 26.6-29.4% SL in T. serena], shorter head (25.2-27.1% SL vs. 26.2-27.3%) and pectoral fin (17.5-19.1% SL vs. 19.5-21.3%), and longer pelvic fin (9.3-10.5% SL vs. 7.8-8.7%).

Examination of materials collected from various soft and hard substrata from depths between 10 and 1200 m in the region revealed the presence of four species, among which one was already known from the region (P. ilvana), one was a new record for the Sea of Marmara (P. armata) and other two (P. heterochaeta n. sp. and P. longifurcata n. sp.) were new to science. Paradoneis heterochaeta n. sp. is characterized mainly by having a proportionately large size, by its pigmentation on the body, by bearing minute notopodial postchaetal lobes and by possessing two types of lyrate chaetae. Paradoneis longifurcata n. sp. is mainly characterized by having weakly jointed notopodial postchaetal lobes and lyrate chaetae with the long branch being up to 4.5 times longer than the short branch. All species found in the area are described and discussed.

(Proseriata: Coelogynoporidae) is described from the northwestern Gulf of Lion, Mediterranean. Only a few representatives of this genus are reported from Mediterranean marine sandy shores and only from the northwestern to central Mediterranean, but all of these species also occur outside the Mediterranean. So far, C. schockaerti n. sp. is the only species exclusively known from the Mediterranean. The species is solely encountered in the Gulf of Lion, a coldwater pocket in the Mediterranean and can, therefore, be considered as a remnant of an ancient coldwater platyhelminth fauna. C. schockaerti n. sp. is characterized by the shape and size of the spines of the male copulatory organ and the presence, orientation, shape and size of the two accessory spines. An identification key is given for the entire genus.	[Jouk, Philippe E. H.] Royal Zool Soc Antwerp, Ctr Res & Conservat, Koningin Astridpl 20-26, B-2018 Antwerp, Belgium; [Jouk, Philippe E.

J	Thomas, MJ; Skejo, J; Heads, SW				Thomas, M. Jared; Skejo, Josip; Heads, Sam W.			The last batrachideine of Europe: A new genus and species of pygmy grasshopper (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) from Eocene Baltic amber	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Caelifera; Tetrigoidea; pygmy locusts; grouse locusts; groundhoppers; Cenozoic; Paleogene; Baltic amber; fossil insects	MIOCENE AMBER	A new genus and species of pygmy grasshopper (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) is described from Eocene Baltic amber. Danatettix hoffeinsorum gen. et sp. nov. is assigned to the subfamily Batrachideinae based on antennae with more than 19 antennomeres, sulcate mesofemora, and rectangular paranota. This species is readily distinguished from other batrachideines by a markedly produced vertex, pronotum with divergent internal and external lateral carinae, and highly setiferous female lateral basivalvular sclerite with scabrose integument. The morphology of Danatettix suggests placement within the here defined Tettigidea genus group (comprising Eutettigidea Hancock, 1914, Paurotarsus Hancock, 1900, and Tettigidea Scudder, 1862) and suggests that the latter had diverged from the new Scaria genus group (comprising Eotetrix Gorochov, 2012, Rehnidium Grant, 1956 and Scaria Bolivar, 1887) by the Early Eocene.

J	Martens, K; Yavuzatmaca, M; Higuti, J				Martens, Koen; Yavuzatmaca, Mehmet; Higuti, Janet			On a new species of the genus Cyprinotus (Crustacea, Ostracoda) from a temporary wetland in New Caledonia (Pacific Ocean), with a reappraisal of the genus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Living non-marine Ostracoda; Heterocypris; taxonomy; morphology; new combinations; doubtful species	MORPHOLOGY	The New Caledonia archipelago is known for its high level of endemism in both faunal and floral groups. Thus far, only 12 species of non-marine ostracods have been reported. After three expeditions to the main island of the archipelago (Grande Terre), about four times as many species were found, about half of which are probably new. Here, we describe a new species, Cyprinotus drubea sp. nov., which is characterised mainly by the hyper-developed dorsal hump on the right valve, much larger than in any other known Recent species in this genus. After a literature study of the other presumed species in Cyprinotus Brady, 1886, we retain seven Recent species in the genus, including the present new species. Cyprinotus crenatus (Turner, 1893), C. dentatus (Sharpe, 1910), C. flavescens Brady, 1898, C. inconstans Furtos, 1936, C. new mexicoensis Ferguson, 1967, C. ohanopecoshensis Ferguson, 1966, C. pellucidus (Sharpe, 1897), C. scytodus (Dobbin, 1941) and C. sulphurous Blake, 1931 are here all referred to the genus Heterocypris s. lat. Claus, 1892. Cyprinotus unispinifera Furtos, 1936 is assigned to the genus Cypricercus Sars, 1895. Cyprinotus tenuis Henry, 1923, C. fuscus Henry, 1919 and C. carinatus (King, 1855) are here classified as doubtful species. A checklist of the 14 non-marine ostracods, now including Cyprinotus drubea sp. nov. and Cypris granulata (Daday, 1910), thus far reported from New Caledonia, is provided. Herpetocypris caledonica Mehes, 1939 and H. caledonica var. minor Mehes, 1939 are synonymised with Candonocypris novaezelandiae (Baird, 1843).

J	Kataev, BM; Schmidt, J				Kataev, Boris M.; Schmidt, Joachim			New data on the irvinei group of Chydaeus of the Himalaya from Nepal and southern Tibet (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Harpalini)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						ground beetles; China; new species; new subspecies; key to species and subspecies	GENUS CHYDAEUS; CHINA	Re-examination of the type series of Chydaeus irvinei (Andrewes, 1930) revealed that this species is based on two different taxa. It is re-described based on the lectotype and two paralectotypes from Gautsa in the Ngamo Chu Valley of southern Tibet between Sikkim and Bhutan. Chydaeus loeffleri (Jedlicka, 1966) is treated as distinct species (not a synonym of Ch. irvinei) with two subspecies: the nominotypical one distributed in the Rolwaling Valley in eastern Central Nepal, and Ch. loeffleri tibetanus ssp. n. described on the basis of the paralectotype of Ch. irvinei from the Rongshar Valley in southern Tibet north west of the Rolwaling Himal.

Pipids have a unique combination of morphological features, some of which appear to represent a mix of adaptations to aquatic life and plesiomorphic characters of Anura. The present study describes the karyotype of Pipa carvalhoi Miranda-Ribeiro, 1937, including morphology, heterochromatin distribution, and location of the NOR site. The diploid number of P. carvalhoi is 2n=20, including three metacentric pairs (1, 4, 8), two submetacentric (2 and 7), three subtelocentric (3, 5, 6), and two telocentric pairs (9 and 10). C-banding detected centromeric blocks of heterochromatin in all chromosome pairs and the NOR detected in chromosome pair 9, as confirmed by FISH using the rDNA 28S probe. The telomeric probes indicated the presence of interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs), primarily in the centromeric region of the chromosomes, frequently associated with heterochromatin, suggesting that these repeats are a significant component of this region. The findings of the present study provide important insights for the understanding of the mechanisms of chromosomal evolution in the genus Pipa, and the diversification of the Pipidae as a whole.

Many studies have been conducted trying to explore the diversity within the complex, leading to the recognition of three major morphotypes: large (L), small-medium (SM), and small (SS). Currently six species have been described and classified under these types and another nine taxa have been identified but not formally described. Within the L group, three species have been officially described [B. plicatilis s.s. (L1), B. manjavacas (L2), and B. asplanchnoidis (L3)], while a formal description of L4, unofficially known as B. 'Nevada', is still lacking. In the present study, a new species, Brachionus paranguensis sp. nov., is formally described and presented as a representative of the L4 clade. The species has been named after a high altitude saline crater lake from Central Mexico, where the specimens were collected. An integrated approach using DNA taxonomy through COI and ITS1 markers, morphology, and ecology was used to confirm the identity of the new species.

Two new species of Bargmannia (Pyrostephidae, Physonectae, Siphonophorae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Siphonophorae; Physonectae; Pyrostephidae; Bargmannia; new species	CNIDARIA	Two new deep-living species of the genus Bargmannia (Siphonophorae, Physonectae, Pyrostephidae) are described based, almost exclusively, on the nectophores of single specimens collected by ROVs off the west coast of California. The nectophores of B. stenotes sp. nov. were relatively small, up to 11.4 mm in length and, in the preserved condition had very narrow nectosacs. There was a marked bend in the distal part of the preserved nectophore, resulting in the ostium opening upwards. The mature nectophores of B. profunda sp. nov. were almost twice as long as those of B. stenotes and were characterised by the fact that the lower lateral ridges did not join, distally, with the meso-lateral ones. This feature also was present in smaller nectophores of B. amoena but those of B. stenotes, at that stage, did not have a mouth-plate.	[Pugh, P.

A neotype for M. bielawskii is herein designated due to the unknown whereabouts of the original holotype. Manahunca silhavyi Avram, 1977, is regarded as a new junior subjective synonym of M. bielawskii. In addition, two new species of Manahunca are described, M. turquino Alegre, Gainett & Giribet, n. sp. and M. matazon Alegre, Gainett & Giribet, n. sp. based on additional specimens from eastern Cuba, for which we provide new data on their geographical distribution, intraspecific variability and habitat. A new diagnosis and emended geographic distribution of the known species of Manahunca are provided, with hints on the current conservation status. The sexually dimorphic glandular structures found on the metatarsus III of males are explored for taxonomic significance in ten species of Stenostygninae. The existence of male dimorphism, most evident in the robustness of the chelicerae, is reported for two of the studied Manahunca species.

Prior to this study, the total number of valid species of Ceroptres, the only genus within Ceroptresini to date, was 23. As a result of this revision, 15 Ceroptres species are retained as valid and one species, Amblynotus ensiger Walsh, 1864, is desynonymized from Ceroptres petiolicola (Osten-Sacken, 1861), being considered here as a valid Ceroptres species: C. ensiger (Walsh, 1864) status verified and comb. nov. An additional five new species are described from Mexico: Ceroptres junquerasi Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar sp. nov.; C. lenis Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar sp. nov.; C. mexicanus Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar sp. nov.; C. nigricrus Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar sp. nov.; C. quadratifacies Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar sp. nov., increasing the total number of valid Ceroptres species to 21. Ceroptres masudai Abe, 1997 is synonymized with C. kovalevi Belizin, 1973. Ceroptres niger Fullaway, 1911 is transferred to Andricus (Andricus confusus Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar comb. nov. and nom. nov.). Five species (Amblynotus inermis Walsh, 1864; Cynips quercusarbos Fitch, 1859; Cynips querficus Fitch, 1859; Cynips quercuspisum Fitch, 1859; and Cynips quercustuber Fitch, 1859) are not considered as valid Ceroptres. The status of Ceroptres quereicola (Shinji, 1938), previously classified as an unplaced species, is commented on. In addition, a Nearctic species from the USA, Ceroptres politus Ashmead, 1896, is here proposed as the type species of a new genus within Ceroptresini: Buffingtonella Lobato-Vila & Pujade-Villar gen. nov. Redescriptions, biological and distribution data, illustrations and keys to genera and species within Ceroptresini are provided. The diagnostic morphological traits of Ceroptresini, Ceroptres and the new genus are discussed.

In Brazil, A. palmata was initially reported from the Ponta Grossa and Sao Domingos formations (Parana Basin), later recorded from the western border of the Parnaiba Basin (Pimenteira Formation, State of Tocantins), and is now shown to occur on the eastern border of the same basin (Pimenteira Formation, State of Piaui). In this paper, we describe a fourth species from the Parana Basin as Australocoelia boucoti n. sp. It differs from A. palmata and the other species of Australocoelia in features of ornamentation and interspace, in addition to paleoecological characteristics.

J	Perissinotto, R; Sipek, P				Perissinotto, Renzo; Sipek, Petr			New species of Xiphoscelis Burmeister, 1842 Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Cetoniinae) from arid regions of South Africa and Namibia	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Afrotropical region; fruit chafers; identification key; immature stages; life cycle; Succulent Karoo; taxonomy; Xiphoscelidini	PHYLOGENY	Two new species of the southern African genus Xiphoscelis Burmeister, 1842 are recognised and described, X. braunsi sp. nov. from the Eastern and Western Cape Karoo (South Africa) and X. namibica sp. nov. from the Huns Mountains of southern Namibia and adjacent ranges in South Africa. These were previously overlooked and grouped together with X. schuckardi Burmeister, 1842, but further material and more in-depth analyses have now revealed their clear separation on the basis of key diagnostic features, including clypeal structure, metatibial spur development and aedeagal shape. The densely and coarsely costate elytral structure and the black to brown colour of these species are symplesiomorphies shared with a number of the most primitive genera among the African Cetoniinae. However, these characters also reflect the convergent adaptation to hot and arid conditions they share with several other species occurring in this region. Phylogenetic relationships of the genus with other Cetoniinae are explored using the larval characters highlighted in the description of the 3rd instar larva of X. braunsi sp. nov. The extraordinary hypertrophy observed in the male metatibial spur of species in this genus, and particularly in X. schuckardi, appears to represent a defence mechanism against potential predators on the ground, apart from playing a role during mating.

In this paper, this knowledge is increased by the description of two new species from Yunnan Province in China. These new species, P. physematosa sp. nov. (female) and P. semilunata sp. nov. (male female), are treated with five previously described ones, P. bibulba Xu & Yin, 2000 (male female), P. signata Jager, 2001 (male female), P. wu Jager, Li & Krehenwinkel, 2015 (male female), P. yinae Jager & Vedel, 2007 (male), and P. yunnanensis Yang & Hu, 2001 (male female), as the newly defined Pseudopoda signata species group. The P. signata group can be distinguished from other groups within Pseudopoda by the male palps with long, slightly broad, S-shaped embolus, small but distinct tegular apophysis, pronounced dRTA and reduced vRTA, and by the female with V-shaped or W-shaped anterior margins of lateral lobes, membranous and wide first winding, long and strongly curved SIDS (sclerotised internal duct system), the latter mostly covered by the first winding. The monophyly of this group is also supported by molecular phylogenetic results mainly based on Chinese Pseudopoda species. In addition, photographs of P. bibulba (male female), P. signata (male female), and P. yunnanensis (male female) are provided. P. bibulba is newly recorded from Guizhou Province and P. signata is newly recorded from Yunnan Province.

Lacunicambarus dalyae: a new species of burrowing crayfish (Decapoda: Cambaridae) from the southeastern United States	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						polychromatus; diogenes; paintedhand mudbug; devil crayfish; jewel mudbug; taxonomy; systematics	FRESH-WATER CRAYFISH; CONSERVATION STATUS; DEVIL CRAYFISH; DIOGENES; EXTINCTION; KENTUCKY; COMPLEX; CUES	The Jewel Mudbug, Lacunicambarus dalyae sp. nov., is a large, colorful primary burrowing crayfish found in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. This species is most similar in appearance to the Paintedhand Mudbug, L. polvchromatus, a species found across the Midwestern United States. The ranges of the two species overlap minimally, and they can be distinguished from each other based on several characters, the most notable of which is the much longer central projection of the gonopod in Form I and II males of L. dalyae sp. nov. relative to L. polvchromatus. Like its congeners, L. dalyae sp. nov. is commonly found in burrows in the banks and floodplains of streams and is resilient to a moderate amount of anthropogenic habitat degradation, being occasionally collected from burrows in roadside ditches and urban lawns.

Furthermore, the phylogeny indicates that the Indochinese populations represent two species, thus resulting in four major lineages within this Glade. These relationships are consistent with multivariate and univariate analyses of morphological and discrete color pattern data which statistically define and diagnose the four lineages and together with the molecular data, provide the foundation for robust, testable, species-level hypotheses. As such, S. stellatus is herein restricted to Peninsular Malaysia; S. annamiticus is resurrected for the circum-continental populations ranging through southeastern Thailand, southern Cambodia, and southern Vietnam; a new species-S. preylangensis sp. nov.-is described from an isolated mountain, Phnom Chi, from the Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary in central Cambodia; and the taxonomy of S. praesignis remains unchanged. The description of S. preylangensis sp. nov. underscores the necessity to conserve this remnant of lowland eveigieen rainforest in the Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary.	[Grismer, L. Lee; Quah, Evan S.

J	Uiblein, F; Gledhill, DC; Pavlov, DA; Hoang, TA; Shaheen, S				Uiblein, Franz; Gledhill, Daniel C.; Pavlov, Dimitri A.; Tuan Anh Hoang; Shaheen, Shaker			Three new goatfishes of the genus Upeneus (Mullidae) from the Indo-Pacific, with a redescription of colour patterns in U. margarethae	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						margarethae species group; meristic characters; body shape; colour patterns; comprehensive alpha taxonomy	PERCIFORMES; SOUTHERN; RECORDS	For the goatfish genus Upeneus Cuvier 1829 (Mullidae), a new taxonomic species group called the "margarethae group" is established which can be distinguished from the six species of the most similar "tragula group" by a combination of the following characteristics: absence of dark pigmentation in the area of the first dorsal-fin tip, 21-25 total gill rakers and 28-30 lateral-line scales. Initially, three recently-described species have been included in the margarethae group: Upeneus margarethae Uiblein & Heemstra. 2010, known from the Indian Ocean including the Red Sea and from the Arafura Sea (W Pacific), U. mouthami Randall & Kulbicki, 2006. from New Caledonia and Vanuatu (W Pacific). and U. randalli Uiblein & Heemstra. 2011. from the Arabian/Persian Gulf and the inner Gulf of Oman (NW Indian Ocean). The present taxonomic review of the margarethae group analyses a large data set of 41 morphometric, 10 meristic and many colour characters obtained from 279 preserved goatfish specimens and 166 fresh-colour photos (plus a fresh-colour drawing). For the nominal species of the group, U matgarethae, a redescription of the colour patterns is provided and new records for Myanmar, Andaman Sea (NE Indian Ocean) and the Gulf of Carpentaria, N Australia (W Pacific), are reported. Three new species are described: U. caudofasciatus n. sp. from the area of the Great Barrier Reef to Torres Strait off NE Australia (Coral Sea, W Pacific), U. gubal n. sp. from the S Gulf of Suez (Northern Red Sea), and U. heterospinus n. sp. from S Indonesia to Singapore, the Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines. China, Taiwan and Japan (W Pacific). A comprehensive alpha-taxonomic approach is adopted, considering population differences as well as intraspecific sizerelated variation in morphology and colour patterns by splitting the data set into two size classes, adults (>= 65 mm SL) and smaller subadults. Inter- and intraspecific comparisons include statistical analyses for species and population with sufficiently large samples sizes (n >= 20). Colour-pattern characterization and analysis are based on photos of recently collected and deceased fish (partly associated with voucher specimens), photos obtained from active or resting fishes in situ or in a tank, and inspection of pigmentation patterns retained in preserved specimens. Species differences are elaborated under consideration of distribution patterns and the characteristics found in the closest-most population of widely distributed species such as U. margarethae. resulting in clear and consistent distinction among the six species in single or in a combination of several characteristics. Comparisons among size classes revealed species-specific patterns in morphometric, meristic and colour changes with increasing size. One species, U. heterospinus n. sp., has seven or eight spines in the dorsal fin which occur in balanced ratio across populations. This is a unique characteristic for Upeneus species which usually have either seven or eight dorsal-fin spines, respectively. The best distinction of Upeneus heterospinus n. sp. from all other congeners is reached by combined examination of dorsal-fin spines with several other characters such as barbel colour, presence of a mid-lateral body stripe, pigmentation patterns (partly retained also in preserved fish), gillraker and pectoral-fin ray numbers, and body-shape variables. The high degree of overall morphological differentation among the three most common species U. caudofasciatus n. sp., U. heterospinus n. sp. and U. margarethae. as revealed by the statistical comparisons, strongly contrasts with a still signficant, but much lower degree of differentiation among populations. The diagnostic characteristics of the margarethae group are updated and the importance to use the results of this taxonomic review in ongoing fisheries-related and ecological research is emphasized. Requirements for future taxonomic research featuring the stunning diversity of the goatfish genus Upeneus are also discussed.

In this paper the genus Cacochroa is revised and this confusion is resolved, a neotype is chosen for C. permixtella and nearly all records verified. Male and female genitalia of C. permixtella are remarkably different from those of the remaining species, which are here placed in Rosetea Corley & Ferreira, gen. nov. The distributions of the three species previously described in Cacochroa are clarified. Cacochroa permixtella has a distribution limited to Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Rosetea corfuella (Lvovsky, 2000), comb. nov., is recorded for the first time from Crete, Croatia, Macedonia, 'flukey and Israel; the male of R. rosetella (Corley. 2018), comb. nov., is described for the first time and the species is recorded for the first time from Spain, France (mainland and Corsica), Italy (mainland and Sardinia), Greece (mainland and Crete), Croatia and Algeria. Rosetea sara sp. nov. is described from North Africa (Morocco and Tunisia). Male and female genitalia and DNA barcode data are presented for all four species.

J	Hoskin, CJ				Hoskin, Conrad J.			Description of three new velvet geckos (Diplodactylidae: Oedura) from inland eastern Australia, and redescription of Oedura monilis De Vis	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Oedura monilis; Oedura elegans sp. nov.; Oedura picta sp. nov.; Oedura lineata sp. nov.; Oedura attenboroughi; Oedura ocellata; Oedura tryoni; Oedura coggeri	NORTH QUEENSLAND	Inland eastern Australia has a complex array of habitats, driven by variation in topography, geology and moisture. This broad region is relatively poorly surveyed compared to coastal eastern Australia and likely contains significant numbers of undescribed reptiles. Oedura monilis is found through much of this region but has been shrouded in taxonomic uncertainty since its original description. Here I assess variation across the range of 'O. monilis' and show that it consists of two species: a widespread species in the northern half of the range and a widespread species in the southern half of the range. These two species are readily diagnosed by colour pattern and aspects of shape and scalation. I show that the name O. monilis applies to the northern species. I also show that the name O. attenboroughi Wells & Wellington applies to the northern populations, making it a junior synonym of O. monilis. I describe the southern widespread species as Oedura elegans sp. nov.. I also describe two new, highly localised species from inland eastern Queensland that are allied to O. monilis: Oedura picta sp. nov. from a rocky range in the Moranbah-Dysart region, and Oedura lineata sp. nov. from brigalow forest remnants in the Arcadia Valley. These two species are distinct for colour pattern and aspects of size, shape and scalation. Oedura lineata sp. nov. has a very small and fragmented range, and is restricted to a highly threatened habitat type. It therefore warrants conservation attention. I also provide more detailed diagnoses for O. coggeri Bustard and O. tryoni De Vis, and demonstrate that the name O. ocellata Boulenger is a junior synonym of O. tryoni.

RUSSIAN WHEAT APHID; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; PARASITOIDS HYMENOPTERA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; DNA; WASP; ASSOCIATIONS; CHECKLIST; BIOTYPES	In this study two molecular markers were used to establish taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships of Ephedrus subgenera and species distributed in Europe. Fifteen of the nineteen currently known species have been analysed, representing three subgenera: Breviephedrus Gardenfors, 1986, Lysephedrus Start, 1958 and Ephedrus Haliday, 1833. The results of analysis of COI and EF1 alpha molecular markers and morphological studies did not support this classification. Three clades separated by the highest genetic distances reported for the subfamily Aphidiinae on intrageneric level. Ephedrus brevis is separated from persicae and plagiator species groups with genetic distances of 19.6 % and 16.3 % respectively, while the distance between persicae and plagiaior groups was 20.7 %. These results lead to the conclusion that the traditional subgeneric classification of Ephedrus needs revision. Species from persicae species group are raised to subgenus level as Fovephedrus Chen, 1986 and Lysephedrus syn. nov. is assigned as a junior synonym of subgenus Ephedrus. Key for identification of Ephedrus subgenera is provided. Ephedrus hyadaphidis Kocic & Tomanovic sp. nov. is described and several species arc confirmed as valid species for the first time. Furthermore, two species are synonymised: E. dysaphidis syn. nov. as a junior synonym of E. cerasicola and E. blattnyi syn. nov. as a junior synonym of E. plagiator.

This work reports some of the first results of an extensive survey implemented in Kibale National Park, Uganda. A total of 456 individuals was caught of the subfamily Rhyssinac Morley, 1913, which in the Afrotropical region was previously known from only 30 specimens. Here, the six species found at the site are described and the Afrotropical Rhyssinae are reviewed. Two new species, Epirhyssajohanna Hopkins, sp. nov. and E. quagga sp. nov., are described and a key, diagnostic characters, and descriptions for all 13 known Afrotropical species arc provided, including the first description of the male of Epirhyssa over/aeti Seyrig, 1937.

A new species of Archaebranchinecta (Anostraca: Branchinectidae) from the South American Altiplano	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Anostraca; Branchinectidae; Archaebranchinecta; new species; resting eggs; high Andean plateau; identification key	FAIRY SHRIMP; BRANCHIOPODA; MORPHOLOGY; CRUSTACEA	A detailed morphological comparison was carried out among specimens of several samples of Archaebranchinecta Rogers & Coronel, 2011 from the Altiplano of Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. Surprisingly, striking differences were found between Peruvian samples collected near the western shore of Lake Titicaca, and those from Bolivia taken southwardly, near the east coasts of River Desaguadero and Lake Poopo. Accordingly, the new species Archaebranchinecta aimara sp. nov. is described, representing the second specific entity of a genus that so far included only A. pollicifera (Harding, 1940). The main differential features between both species include: (a) size and shape of the three processes of basal segment of the male second antenna; (b) shape and protrusion degree of the pair of medioventral bulges in the male genital segments; (c) presence or absence of strong ventrolateral spine on the second genital segment of female; and (d) presence or absence of a pair of ventrolateral outgrowths in the brood pouch. This research contributes to our understanding of the biodiversity and endemism of the unique Altiplano region of South America.

LEAF-TAILED GECKOS; STUMP-TOED FROGS; SQUAMATA GEKKONIDAE; TSINGY; ENVIRONMENTS; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; RADIATION; TAXONOMY; MASSIF	Previous studies on leaf-tailed geckos of the genus Uroplatus identified a lineage from the Ankarana karst massif in northern Madagascar as genetically highly divergent, but only fragmentary information was available on these geckos. Here, we provide an integrative analysis based on molecular and morphological data, including a newly collected specimen from this locality. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Ankarana lineage sister to U. ebenaui, but with a surprisingly high genetic divergence of over 19% uncorrected pairwise distance in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. We formally describe the Ankarana lineage as Uroplatus fetsy sp. nov. and provide new information on the distribution and genetic differentiation of its sister species, Umplatus ebenaui. Based on DNA sequences of newly examined samples this latter species is confirmed as widespread, ranging from low-elevation dry forests from Beanka in western Madagascar to Foret d'Ambre and Analalava/Fanambana in northern Madagascar, and thus far has not been found in the Ankarana Massif, where U. fetsy occurs.

A total of 25 species have been confirmed as present across the region, although another 10 likely occur south of the Mexico-United States border. Three species are newly described-E. hanusiae sp. nov., E. nomadiformis sp. nov. and E. odyneroides sp. nov.-and redescriptions are provided for species occurring exclusively south of the United States of America (species occurring north of Mexico were recently revised elsewhere) except E. danieli (Genaro, 2014) comb. nov., which was recently described. One subspecies is elevated to species level (E. obscuripes Cockerell, 1917 stat. nov.). The following five names are newly synonymized under those of four valid species: Trophocleptria schraderi Michener, 1954 syn. nov. under E. boliviensis Friese, 1908, Tro. odontothorax Michener, 1954 syn. nov. under E. claripennis Friese, 1908, E. rugosus Cockerell, 1949 syn. nov. and E. xanthurus Cockerell, 1917 syn. nov. under E. luteipennis Friese, 1916, and E. schmidti Friese, 1925 syn. nov. under E. obscuripes. A diagnosis is provided for the presumably monophyletic and almost entirely Neotropical species group originally regarded as a separate genus, Trophocleptria Holmberg, 1886. Differential diagnoses accompany the descriptions/redescriptions of Neotropical species of Epeolus, and known collection records and information about their ecology are presented.

J	Galea, HR; Schuchert, P				Galea, Horia R.; Schuchert, Peter			Some thecate hydroids (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) from off New Caledonia collected during KANACONO and KANADEEP expeditions of the French Tropical Deep-Sea Benthos Program	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY			English	Article						Deep water; Leptothecata; taxonomy; new species; 16S DNA barcoding	WESTERN PACIFIC; ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONS; SERTULARIIDAE; BIODIVERSITY; ALLMAN; GENUS	Thirty-six species of various thecate hydroids occur in two recent, deep-water collections from off New Caledonia. Of these, nine are new, namely Solenoscyphus subtilis Galea, sp. nov., Hincksella immersa Galea, sp. nov., Synthecium rectangulatum Galea, sp. nov., Aphasia alternata Galea, sp. nov., Dynamena opposita Galea, sp. nov., Hydrallmania clavaformis Galea, sp. nov., Symplectoscyphus acutustriatus Galea, sp. nov., Symplectoscyphus elongatulus Galea, sp. nov. and Zygophylax niger Galea, sp. nov. The male and female gonothecae of Caledoniana decussata Galea, 2015, the female gonothecae of Caledoniana microgona Galea, 2015, as well as the gonothecae of both sexes of Solenoscyphus striatus Galea, 2015 are described for the first time. The systematic position of the genera Solenoscyphus Galea, 2015 and Caledoniana Galea, 2015 is discussed on both morphological and molecular grounds, and both are confidently placed within the family Staurothecidae Maronna et al., 2016. In light of the molecular data, the genera Billardia Totton, 1930 and Dictyocladium Allman, 1888 are assigned to the families Syntheciidae Marktanner-Turneretscher, 1890 and Symplectoscyphidae Maronna et al., 2016, respectively. The previously undescribed gonothecac of Hincksella neocaledonica Galca, 2015, and the male gonothecae of Sertularella tronconica Galea, 2016, were found. Thyroscyphus scorpioides Vervoort, 1993, a peculiar hydroid with putative stem nematothecae, is redescribed and assigned to the new genus Tuberocaulus Galea, gen. nov. Noteworthy new records from the study area are: Tasmanaria edentula (Bale, 1924), Hincksella sibogae Billard, 1918, Dictyocladium reticulatum (Kirchenpaucr, 1884), Salacia sinuosa (Bale, 1888) and Billardia hyalina Vervoort & Watson, 2003. Most species are illustrated to facilitate their identification, and the morphology of the new ones is compared to that of their related congeners.

Engertia allolepis sp. nov. from Ambon Island in the Moluccas, Indonesia, can be distinguished from the other species of the genus by the heterogeneous setosity on the elytra as well as by a very robust and arcuate aedeagus. Philacelota leucothea sp. nov. from Luzon Island, Philippines, differs from the other species of Philacelota in the scaled whitish vestiture of the pronotum and elytra, as well as in the unidentate protibiae and in the shape of parameres. The length of the 3rd antennomere is the only reliable character for the separation of the genera Engertia and Philacelota. A revised dichotomous key for identification of males and females of all species of Engertia and Philacelota is given. The genus Philacelota is reported from the Philippines for the first time.

Currently, 18 species are known from the area covering the island of Cyprus and mainland from Hatay province of Turkey to Israel. Six species are described as new for science: Lacon mucheibensis sp. nov. (Israel), L. qatanensis sp. nov. (Syria), L. platiai sp. nov. (Jordan), L. safitensis sp. nov. (Syria), L. tafilensis sp. nov. (Jordan), and L. zenobiae sp. nov. (Lebanon, Syria). Lacon freidbergi Platia, 2010 is synonymized with L. lithophilus (Candeze, 1857), and L. kapleri Platia & Schimmel, 1994 with L. graecus (Candeze, 1857). Lacon drusus (Marseul, 1870) is recorded for the first time from Israel. Lacon lithophilus is recorded for the first time from Israel and Jordan. Lacon graecus is removed from the fauna of Levant, because all earlier reports of this species from Lebanon and Syria were based on misidentifications. Figures of habitus and main diagnostic features are provided for all species and an identification key to the Lacon species of the Levant is given.

They are the fourth and first species described in their respective genus in Japan within the Recent Bairdiidae. The description of the two new species is based on scanning electron microscopic investigation of carapaces and on the analysis of anatomy and chaetotaxy of appendages. Scanning electron microscopy of the carapace and soft-part anatomy of appendages of the two new species provided the complete species description. An asymmetric brush-shaped organ, with the right part considerably larger than the left part, is found in both species; this characteristic is suggested to be synapomorphic for some taxa in the family Bairdiidae.

Eight species are described: Microscydmus okinawanus sp. n., M oharaensis sp. n., M. nishimeanus sp. n., M kochiensis sp. n., M elytratus sp. n., M. tibialis sp. n., M. yusuharanus sp. n., and M omogonus sp. n. All new species are placed in the nominotypical subgenus, and Japan becomes a country that houses the greatest recorded species richness of Microscydmus (s. str.). The new species are distributed on Shikoku and in the Ryukyus. A novel character was found, previously unknown in Microscydmus: a pair of long lateral setae on the posterior margin of vertex, clearly visible in some of the newly described species. These setae are not thicker than surrounding ones, but stand out because of their remarkable length. A re-examination of SEM images obtained during previous studies confirmed the presence of these setae also in M. nanus, the European type species of the genus, in which, however, these setae are obscured by surrounding vestiture.

It includes two new species, Laspionchis boucheti Dayrat & Goulding, sp. nov., and Laspionchis bourkei Dayrat & Goulding, sp. nov., both distributed from the Malacca Strait to the Philippines and Australia. This study is based on extensive field work in South-East Asia, comparative anatomy, and both mitochondria! (COI and 16S) and nuclear (ITS2 and 28S) DNA sequences. The two new species are found in the same habitat (mud surface in mangrove forests) and are externally cryptic but are distinct anatomically. Both species are also strongly supported by DNA sequences. Three cryptic, least-inclusive, reciprocally-monophyletic units within Laspionchis bourkei arc regarded as subspecies: L. bourkei bourkei Dayrat & Goulding, asp. nov., L. bourkei lateriensis Dayrat & Goulding, asp. nov., and L. bourkei matangensis Dayrat & Goulding, sap. nov. The present contribution shows again that species delineation is greatly enhanced by considering comparative anatomy and nuclear DNA sequences in addition to mitochondrial DNA sequences, and that thorough taxonomic revisions are the best and most efficient path to accurate biodiversity knowledge.

A second subterranean species already known from three caves in northwest Sicily near Palermo, Campodea (Campodea) majorica sicula Conde, 1957, also was studied. Both species were characterized with SEM. Each species belongs to a different monophyletic group: Plusiocampa s. str., with thoracic medial posterior macrosetae, and the group related to Campodea (Campodea) grassi Silvestri, 1912. Both groups are widely distributed on almost all of the large western Mediterranean islands. Nevertheless, although these two monophyletic groups have a different origin both could be dispersed via land connections between the mainland and the islands during the Messinian Age. This new discovery shows the great value of Sicilian caves that hold species with unique features and of high biogeographic significance.

Baetis pentophyllus sp. nov., a new species of mayfly (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) from the Russian Far East	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Mayflies; larvae; taxonomy; DNA barcoding; lutheri-group; Asia	SYSTEMATICS; NIGROBAETIS; GENERA	A new species, Baetis pentaphyllus sp. nov., is described on the basis of larvae from the Far East of Russia (type locality Bolshoi Garmakan River). Larvae of Baetis pentaphyllus sp. nov. may be distinguished from other Baetis species by the presence of only five pairs of tergalii on segments III-VII. The mitochondrial COT sequence obtained from the described species was compared with the data present in GeneBank and BOLD. The DNA barcodes allowed discrimination of B. pentaphyllus sp. nov. from other species of Baetis with available sequence data. The average interspecific K2P distances were 10-15%, which are values well above those associated with intraspecific variation. COT sequences as well as 36 morphological larval characters were analysed using Bayesian inference to relate the described species to the recognized species-groups of the Baetis genus. B. pentaphyllus sp. nov formed a sister Glade to B. vardarensis + B. lutheri which belong to the Baetis lutheri species-group.

For P. sinensis n. sp., the tubular stylet is slightly curved at the distal end and a fusiform structure with a flange is present at 66% of the stylet. The flange encircles the stylet, with its ends attached to the midpoint and the distal end of the stylet. For P. shenzhenensis n. sp., the stylet has a N-shaped overall morphology. A band provided with dense needle-like structures is present at the distal end of the stylet. Both the morphological (stylet) and phylogenetic (18S rDNA and 28S rDNA) analyses support the establishment of these two new species.

Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences recovered a monophyletic relationship among all Puppet Toads, with two distinct evolutionary clades, a northern and a southern. The northern Glade includes Sigalegalephrynus gayoluesensis sp. nov., and S. burnitelongensis sp. nov., and the southern Glade includes S. harveyi sp. nov., S. mandailinguensis, and S. minangkabauensis. With the discovery of these three new species, Sigalegalephrynus contains more endemic species than any other genus of toad in Indonesia. We used maximum entropy, implemented in MaxEnt, to identify suitable habitats and occurrence probability of additional undescribed new species from the island. The most important predictors of Sigalegalephrynus distribution were elevation (64.5%) and land cover (7.11%). Based on the probability of presence, it is likely that there are many more species of the genus awaiting discovery in Sumatra. Our analysis, based on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species category and criteria, shows that all of the five species of Sigalegalephrynus are in great risk of extinction and should be placed into the Endangered (EN) category of IUCN Red List.

Comparative genomics of Bifidobacterium species isolated from marmosets and humans	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Bifidobacterium; genomics; humans; marmosets	HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME; SP NOV.; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; FECES; SEQUENCE; HEALTH; IDENTIFICATION; ADAPTATION; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION	The genus Bifidobacterium is purported to have beneficial consequences for human health and is a major component of many gastrointestinal probiotics. Although species of Bifidobacterium are generally at low relative frequency in the adult human gastrointestinal tract, they can constitute high proportions of the gastrointestinal communities of adult marmosets. To identify genes that might be important for the maintenance of Bifidobacterium in adult marmosets, ten strains of Bifidobacterium were isolated from the feces of seven adult marmosets, and their genomes were sequenced. There were six B. reuteri strains, two B. callitrichos strains, one B. myosotis sp. nov. and one B. tissieri sp. nov. among our isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the four species we isolated were most closely related to B. bifidum, B. breve and B. longum, which are species found in high abundance in human infants. There were 1357 genes that were shared by at least one strain of B. reuteri, B. callitrichos, B. breve, and B. longum, and 987 genes that were found in all strains of the four species. There were 106 genes found in B. reuteri and B. callitrichos but not in human bifidobacteria, and several of these genes were involved in nutrient uptake. These pathways for nutrient uptake appeared to be specific to Bifidobacterium from New World monkeys. Additionally, the distribution of Bifidobacterium in fecal samples from captive adult marmosets constituted as much as 80% of the gut microbiome, although this was variable between individuals and colonies. We suggest that nutrient transporters may be important for the maintenance of Bifidobacterium during adulthood in marmosets. Research Highlights Bifidobacterium from marmosets are close relatives of those from tamarins. 72% of adult marmosets had relative abundances of Bifidobacterium greater than 10%. Genes involved in nutrient uptake may allow Bifidobacterium to flourish in adult marmosets.

Dendropsyllus kimi sp. nov. differs from its congeners by the one-segmented female P3 endopod, the inner spine on female P5 exopod and the absence of sensillate tubercles on abdominal somites 1 and 2. Dimorphipodia gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate Dimorphipodia changi sp. nov. and can be differentiated from its sister taxon, Arthuricornua, by the sexual dimorphism in P2-P4 exp-3, the absence of paired laterodorsal processes near the posterior margin of the cephalothorax and the presence of pleural setular tufts on somites bearing P2-P4. Ancorabolina, previously placed in the Ancorabolinae, is transferred to the Laophontodinae, whereas Patagoniaella is provisionally reassigned to the family Cletodidae. Within Laophontodes, the inadequately described Laophontodes brevis, Laophontodes ornatus and Laophontodes propinquus are relegated to species inquirendae. Laophontodes georgei sp. nov. is proposed for the unavailable name Laophontodes norvegicus, Laophontodes multispinatus is reassigned to Lobopleura, and Laophontodes gracilipes is fixed as the type of Rostrophontodes gen. nov., the potential sister group of Ancorabolina. The authenticity of Laophontodes bicornis and other dubious ancorabolid records from the Korean peninsula is discussed. Updated keys to genera of both Ancorabolinae and Laophontodinae and to species of Laophontodes are provided.

Infernovenator steenae, a new serpentine recumbirostran from the 'Mazon Creek' Lagerstatte further clarifies lysorophian origins	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Carboniferous; fossil; Microsauria; Molgophidae; Pennsylvanian; Recumbirostra	CRANIAL MORPHOLOGY; TAXONOMIC REVISION; LEPOSPONDYLI; TETRAPODA; AMPHIBIANS; ROTLIEGEND; EVOLUTION; KANSAS	The Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian; 309-307 Mya) 'Mazon Creek' Lagerstatte produces some of the earliest tetrapod fossils of major Palaeozoic lineages. Previously, the Mazon Creek record of lysorophians was known from a single poorly preserved specimen consisting only of a partial vertebral column. Here we describe a new, virtually complete lysorophian genus and species, Infernovenator steenae gen. & sp. nov. on the basis of a unique combination of characters, including a near complete circumorbital series and the retention of a postfrontal. Parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis placed the new taxon in the family Molgophidae, as sister to Brachydectes newberryi. Those results and the more generalized cranial morphology present in Infernovenator further support a recumbirostran origin of Molgophidae. Co-occurrence of two morphologically and functionally distinct molgophids in the Early Moscovian suggests a rapid and underappreciated diversification of this family in the Early Pennsylvanian.

Several species of this genus are hosts of important zoonotic diseases and parasites. The evolutionary history and dispersal routes of these mice remain unclear and the distribution of these species in China was poorly explored in previous studies. We here investigate the divergence times and historical geographical evolution of Apodemus and study the taxonomy of species in China by integrating molecular and morphological data. The crown age of this genus is dated to the Late Miocene, approximately 9.84 Mya. Western and Central Asia were inferred as the most likely ancestral area of this genus. Moreover, we recognize nine living species of Apodemus in China: Apodemus uralensis, A. agrarius, A. chevrieri, A. latronum, A. peninsulae, A. draco, A. ilex, A. semotus and A. nigrus sp. nov., the last from the highlands (elevation > 1984 m) of Fanjing Mountain in Guizhou Province and Jinfo Mountain in Chongqing Province. This new species diverged from A. draco, A. semotus and A. ilex approximately 4.53 Mya. The discovery of A. nigrus highlights the importance of high mountains as refugia and 'isolated ecological islands' for temperate species in south-eastern China.

Recent research on Bathynellidae in Western Australia (Pilbara) has uncovered new taxa with unexpected distributions and phylogenetic relationships, but the biogeographical processes that drive their diversification on the continent are still unclear. By exploring the diversity, distribution, and divergence time of Bathynellidae in a setting such as the perched and isolated aquifers of the Cleaverville Formation in the north of the De Grey River catchment (Pilbara), we aim to test the hypothesis that vicariance has shaped the distribution of this family, specifically if one or multiple vicariant events were involved. We analysed the specimens collected from perched water in different plateaus of the Cleaverville Formation, combining morphological and molecular data from mitochondrial and nuclear genes. We described two new species and genera (Anguillanella callawaensis gen. et sp. nov. and Muccanella cundalinensis gen. et sp. nov.), and two additional taxa are recognised using morphology and/or Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and Poisson Tree Processes species delimitation methods. New genera and species result restricted to isolate perched aquifers on single plateaus and their distributions, phylogenetic relationships, and divergence time estimates support multiple vicariant events and ancient allopatric speciation.

On the basis of molecular, morphological and acoustic evidence, we describe a new species of large-sized Megophrys, once confused with M. nasuta. The new species Megophrys kalimantanensis sp. nov. can be differentiated from all its congeners by large genetic distance more than 6.11% in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, much shorter rostral and orbital appendages, and unique advertisement call. This new species has been recorded from medium to high altitudes of mountain forest in southern and northernmost Borneo.

(Oxyuridomorpha: Thelastomatidae) from Vietnamese wood-burrowing cockroaches (Panesthiinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						cockroach host; Desmicola; hindgut; key; new species; scanning electron microscopy; taxonomy	NEMATODA; OXYURIDA	A new thelastomatid species, Desmicola lamdongensis sp. n. from the hindgut of Panesthiinae cockroaches collected in Bi Doup-Nui Ba National Park, Vietnam is described and illustrated. Males of the new species are characterized by seven to eight modified ventrally projected cuticular annuli on the posterior third of body and the straight spicule with a pointed distal tip; females are distinguished by the presence of tiny circular protrusions on the lip surface, three setiform sensilla as interlabial formations, horseshoe-shaped amphids and smooth oval egg-shells. D. lamdongensis sp. n. differs from the rest of Desmicola species in having males with ventrally projected cuticular annuli on the posterior body third vs. semispherical ventral cuticular protuberance. Similarly to females of other species of the genus, females of D. lamdongensis sp. n. possess a seminal receptacle only on the posterior branch of the reproductive system that allows them to produce a mixture of fertilized and non-fertilized eggs among their progeny.

MURIDAE; SP-N NEMATODA; ENDEMIC MURINES; IRIAN-JAYA; HELMINTHS; PARASITES; SULAWESI; HYDROMYINAE; OXYURIDAE; GENERA	Nematodes from six families, comprising 20 species identified to genus level and three to subfamily level as well as juveniles and a heligmonellid that could not be identified further, were recovered from 34 individuals of Paramelomys plaryops, one P. cfplayops and one Melomys sp. (Muridae: Murinae: Uromys Division) from Papua Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Ascaridid larvae, a capillariid, Capillaria s. l., two putative species of the Nippostrongylinae and a small number of heligmonellid males and females, could not be identified further. The rictulariid Pterygodermatites sp. (females only) had not been reported previously from Sahulan Old Endemic fauna while three species, the oxyurid Syphacia longecauda, the molineid Hepatojarakus pvknofasciatus, and the spirurid Protospirura kaindiensis, had The remaining species, all heligmonellids, included the brevistriatine Macrostrongylus ingens and 14 nippostrongyline species. Of these, Hughjonestrongylus amplicauda, H. singauwaensis, Melomystrongvlus sepikensis, Mawsonema mokwanense, Odilia mackerrasae and Parasabanema szalayi had been reported previously. Species of Hasanuddina, .Montistrongvlus and Sanduanensis possibly as yet undescribed, could not be identified further. Flannerystrongylus abulus n. gen., n. sp. differed from all 41 genera described to date in having a synlophe of 14-16 evenly sized ridges with a sub frontal orientation. Hasegawanema yumense n. sp. with 21-23 synlophe ridges was distinguished from its congeners by a combination of characters including length of spicule, cuticularisation of the genital cone, the proportions of the ovejector and the size of the eggs. Hughjonestrongylus pervulgatus n. sp.. H. vanimoensis a sp. and H. wanumaensis n. sp. were distinguished from all other species of IIughjonestrongvlus and each other by a combination of characters including the number of synlophe ridges 25-30, 18, 22-23 in the mid body respectively, and spicule length, proportions of the ovejector and shape of the female tail. A key to the species of Hughjonestrongylus is provided. Species richness was greater than that recorded for P. lorentzii and P. rubex with about 86% of possible species found, as indicated by bootstrap analysis. The helminth assemblage was dominated by heligmonellids with eight species being unique to P. platyops. Paramelomys lorentzii is found at altitudes up to 1500 m and may provide a link between the lowland P. platyops and the highland P. rubex, thus facilitating the distribution of helminth species held in common.

An integrative taxonomy approach was applied, by combining morphological and morphometric analyses using light contract microscopy (LCM)) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with genetic analysis (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS-2 and COI markers), to cross-verify the status of the newly discovered population as a new species. By the presence of fully developed areolation around egg processes bases and well developed oral cavity armature (OCA), with all three bands of teeth visible under (LCM), the new species, Mesobiotus datanlanicus sp. nov., is most similar to seven taxa from the harmsworthi complex: M barbarae (Kaczmarek, Michalczyk & Degma, 2007), M. hieronimi (Pilato & Claxton, 1988), M. insanis Mapalo, Stec, Mirano-Bascos & Michalczyk, 2017, M. neuquensis (Rossi, Claps & Ardohain, 2009), M. nuragicus (Pilato & Sperlinga, 1975), M. pseudoliviae (Pilato & Binda, 1996), M. pseudonuragicus (Pilato, Binda, & Lisi, 2004), but differs from them mainly by some specific characters of the egg and adult morphology as well as by morphometrics.

Following this, the taxonomic status of Serpinema was challenged by different authors considering it as a subgenus or junior synonym of Camallanus. Several specimens of these nematodes were retrieved from the spot-legged wood turtle Rhinoclemmys punctularia from Cayenne, French Guiana. These specimens clearly differed from previously reported Serpinema and Camallanus species parasitising turtles by the number of caudal papillae, shape of spicules and development of vulvar lips. Based on morphological characters the nematodes were assigned to the genus Serpinema and described as a new species S. cayennensis n. sp.

According to morphological characters and distribution, the species are divided into three informal groups (the number of species ascribed to the group is in brackets). These are the Solariola doderoi group (15), the Solariola gestroi group (14) and the Solariola paganettii group (14). We present keys for the identification of the genus among the Palaeartic Peritelini and keys to identify all species groups and species. Distribution maps and data on ecology and phenology are also provided. In addition to the following nine species already belonging to the genus we list 34 new species as well: Solariola gestroi (A. & F. Solari, 1903), Solariola paganeiiii (Flach, 1905), Solariola doderoi A. & F. Solari (1923), Solariola hirtula (A. & F. Solari,1923), Solariola vitalei A. & F.

Speciation in this region arises from multiple factors, such as topography, climate fluctuations, oceanic transgression, vegetation and the delimitation of zones circumscribed by sub-basins within the greater Amazon basin. Different scenarios have been proposed to better understand the diversification of Amazonian taxa, whether by Pleistocene refugia or by areas of endemism. The genus Scaria is distributed mostly in Amazonia. with a single species that ranges from the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena ecoregion well into Central America all the way to southern Nicaragua. Eight species are currently recognized, with three additional described here as new: Scaria rafaeli sp. nov.. S. jonasi sp. nov. and S. granti sp. nov., and the status of S. laeta stat. resurr. is revalidated. Two new combinations are established: S. verutum comb. nov. (formerly placed in Rehnidium Grant, 1956) and Batrachidea brevis comb. nov. (formerly placed in Scaria). New synonym is proposed: Batrachidea brevis (Hancock, 1909) = Batrachidea inermis Hebard, 1923 syn. nov. Lectotypes and paralectotypes were selected for S. laeta, S. maculata and S. lineata, as well as the neotypes for S. hamata and S. boliviana. An updated key to species of Scaria is also provided. A cladistic analysis for 15 species was performed (12 in the inner group and 3 in the outer group) with 40 morphological characters. confirming the monophyly of Scaria. A biogeographical analysis of dispersion-vicariance indicates that the origin of the genus was probably in the Inambari endemism center as the only reconstruction of the resulting ancestral distribution, five dispersions and three vicariance events being postulated. These suggest that both types of events are equally important in the current configuration of the distribution in Scaria. Vicariance events arise mostly by isolation of the species because of the uplift of the Andes and the dispersion events comprise four waves originating from the ancestral range into central and east Amazonia.

Phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial markers (ND4 and 12S rRNA) reveals five separately evolving lineages (clades) in the S. brosseti species complex. Each can be assigned to a particular geographical range within the distribution area in Morocco: North, South, Anti-Atlas, East and Southeast. A dichotomous key for all species within the genus Saurodactylus is presented. Despite the high level of color pattern variation among and within the northern, southern, Anti-Atlas and eastern clades, the southeastern lineage shows a unique coloration which is not found in other clades. The ecological traits of the southeastern Glade seem to differ from those of the other four lineages since it is basically associated with Acacia species. Like the relictual ecosystem characterized by these trees, it appears to be highly threatened by extinction.

(Trematoda: Monorchioidea), a new aberrant representative of lissorchiid trematodes from the sidestripe rasbora, Rasbora paviana Tirant (Actinopterygii: Cyprinidae), Vietnam	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Digenea; freshwater; helminths; Lissorchiidae; progenetic metacercariae; taxonomy	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; LIFE-CYCLE; MOLECULAR-DATA; MONORCHIIDAE; DIGENEA; FISHES; PLATYHELMINTHES; PHYLOGENY; PROGENESIS; MORPHOLOGY	In this paper we erect Asaccotrema n. gen. of Lissorchiidae Magath, 1917 (Trematoda, Monorchioidea) and provide a description of Asaccotrema vietnamiense n. sp., that infects freshwater fish in Vietnam. The morphology of Asaccotrema n. gen. is significantly different from that of other lissorchiid genera due to the absence of the cirrus-sac. and position of the genital pore sublaterally, near the middle level of the esophagm. The male terminal genitalia are characterized by the presence of the seminal vesicle, which is surrounded by prostate gland-cells, a tubular pals prostatica and a long unarmed ejaculatory duct. The terminal portion of the cluster of prostate gland-cells, which surrounds pars prostatica and the distal end of seminal vesicle, is covered with a thin-walled open-ended membrane, and the other constituents of the male terminal genitalia are naked. Asaccotrema vietnamiense n. sp. specimens are found as progenetic metacercariae on the liver of the sidestripe rasbora, Rasbora paviana Tirant (Actinopterygii: Cyprinidae). A partial sequence was obtained for the 28S rRNA gene (rDNA) of A. vietnamiense n. sp. The 28S rDNA-based phylogenetic analyses support the integration of A. vietnamiense n. sp. into the Lissorchiidae Glade, which also includes Lissorchis kritskyi Barnhart & Powell, 1979 and Asymphylodora perccotti Besprozvanykh, Ermolenko & Atopkin, 2012. This is the second record of a lissorchiid species in fish in Vietnam.

J	Hiller, A; Werding, B				Hiller, Alexandra; Werding, Bernd			A new species of Petrolisthes (Crustacea, Anomura, Porcellanidae) inhabiting vermetid formations Mollusca, Gastropoda, Vermetidae) in the southern Caribbean Sea	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						West Atlantic; Petrolisthes virgilius sp. nov.; Petrolisthes tonsorius; ecological differences; color morphs; vermetid formations; mitochondrial marker	DECAPODA; MORPHOLOGY; GALATHEIDAE; COMPLEX; COLOR	Petrolisthes virgilius sp. nov. from the Caribbean Sea of Colombia is described. The new species resembles P. tonsorius morphologically but differs from it principally by its color and habitat. Petrolisthes tonsorius is brown or blueish brown and occurs under intertidal boulders strongly exposed to water movement. Petrolisthes virgilius sp. nov. is pale brown to beige and lives exclusively in intertidal areas dominated by vermetid snails, exposed to heavy wave action. The entangled tubular shells of vermetids are cemented to each other and to a hard substrate like beach rock, forming a microhabitat for the new crab species and other porcellanids of the genera Neopisosoma and Clastotoechus. Large genetic distances between DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene from P. virgilius sp. nov. and P. tonsorius confirmed that they comprise different species. Petrolisthes virgilius sp. nov. is the 53rd member of the West Atlantic porcellanid fauna.

J	Johnson, JW; Wilmer, JW				Johnson, Jeffrey W.; Wilmer, Jessica Worthington			Epinephelus fuscorarginatus (Perciformes: Epinephelidae), a new species o grouper from off the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Epinephelus epistictus; Epinephelus magniscuttis; Great Barrier Reef; DNA barcoding	SERRANIDAE; MODEL; RECORD	A new species of epinephelid fish from northeastern Australia is described based on five specimens 408-564 mm SL collected by deep water demersal dropline fishing. Epinephelus fuscomarginatus sp. nov. is known from the Capricorn Channel, off the southern end of the Swain Reefs, Qld, Australia, in depths of 220-230 m. It is distinguished by a combination of dorsal-fin rays XI, 14, pectoral-fin rays 17, anal-fin rays III, 8, caudal-fin rounded, lateral-line scales 60-67, gill rakers 9-10 + 16-19 = 25-28, body depth 3.0-3.4 in SL, angle of preopercle broadly rounded, bearing 4-9 small non-prominent serrae, midlateral part of lower jaw with 2 rows of teeth, tooth patches on vomer and palatines narrow, in 2-3 and 2-4 rows, respectively, and coloration including broad dark brown margins to the soft dorsal, anal and caudal fins. There are no dark spots on the head, body, or fins at any known size and in subadults there are two faint pale brown bars radiating from the eye to the posterior margin of the opercle, and diffuse irregular brown wavy bars and blotches on the sides of the body. Comparison of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO 1) genetic marker utilised in DNA barcoding produced modest but consistent genetic divergences of 1.10% and 2.70 % between E. fuscomarginatus sp. nov. and its closest sampled congeners, E. magniscuttis and E. epistictus, respectively. Further evidence is presented to indicate that populations of E. epistictus currently recognised from the Indian Ocean east to the Indo-Australian Archipelago may be distinct from those from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea.
